An Account of BOOK S.
I. Osservationi Naturali, ove si contengono materie Medico-Fisiche, &amp;c. Natural Observations, containing several Medico-Physical
and Botanical Matters, with divers Natural
Productions, several sorts of Phosphori, Subterraneous Fires in Italy, and other Curious
Subjects, in Familiar Letters, by Signior Paul
Boccone, M. D. Printed at Bononia in 120
1684.
OUR Commerce with the Italian Booksellers having been for several Years less constant, it may
not be amiss to present the Reader with an Account of
some of the most Curious relating chiefly to Natural
History or Philosophy.
I shall begin with an Abstract of this Miscellaneous
Treatise of the Ingenious Boccone, written in Italian,
and containing Twenty Six several Observations. The
Author had formerly publisht in French Natural Enquiries and Observations on Corall Astroites, &amp;c. at Paris,
Anno 1671. reprinted afterwards at Amsterdam in 1674.
and at Oxford his Icons and Descriptions of the rare
Plants of Sicilia, &amp;c. were Printed Anno 1674.
In the First of the Observations, contained in this
Tract the Author treats of the Effects, Causes, and Preparation of the Noctiluca or Phosphorus Aerous, as it was
made by the Honourable Boyle. The 2d. Obs. is of Subterraneous Fires and their Phaenomena and Cause from
the Effervescence of an Acid and Alcali, with-an Ethereal or Subtile Matter interposed. The 3d. Obs. is of

Cures and Preservatives from the Plague, where he so
much extols Vesicatories, which in the Year 1656 preserved as many as made use of them, when the Plague
was very hot at Genoa. And here he Observes by the
way, that the Root of Colchicum is no other ways a good
Remedy in this case, than as being a sort of gentle Vesicatory, from the Acrious Particles of which it consists,
and not as an Amulet, as some have supposed. In the
4th. Obs. He Discourses of the Iron Rings made of the
Nail (taken out of a Stone-Horse's near Foot before)
by hammering only without Fire, as good for the Cramp
and Giddiness, worn on the Ring-Finger, which if of
any prevalency, he says it is from the Volatile Particles
it received from the Horse's Hoof, and not as any Charm.
The 5th. Obs. Contains a Catalogue of Natural Effects
usually attributed to Sympathy. The 6th. Obs. Treats
of a Succedaneum to Crabs-Eyes, of the little Chalky
Stones found on the outsides of the Scait Fish on the Pastinaca Marina, &amp;c. The 7th. Obs. Is of several rare Plants,
and some Empirick Remedies chiefly against Witchcraft.
The 8th. Obs. Describes a certain Smoaking Liquor
made of Mercury and Tin. The 9th. Discourses of yellow and black Amber found in divers Places of Italy, a
new Discovery to most. The 10th. Obs. Is of the
Bed of a certain Insect (not unlike those with several
little Cellules made by Bees or Flies in hollow Trees, or
on the Leaves of Plants) found in the midst of an
Oyster-shell in Mount Marius. The 11th. Obs. Is of several Animalcules found in little shelly Tubes. The
12th. Treats of the Vertues of several Plants for divers
Diseases of Beasts. The 13th. is of a certain Man that
after his Wifes Death suckled his Child at his own Breasts,
Anno 1633. which he confirms by a Credible Testimony. The 14th. Obs. Gives us an Account of the
several Museums or Repositories of Curiosities to be seen
in Italy. The 15th. Obs. Discovers the Author's Method</page>
<page id="35">
thod of Preparing the Bononian Stone or Phosphorus: to
which is subjoyned a Curious Observation communicated
to him by Joh. Baptista Martelli, concerning Humane
Urine. The 16th. Obs. Enumerates several Earthy
Concrets, good for absorbing and correcting Acids. The
17th. Obs. Defends the harmless use of Antimony, much
esteeming the Panacaea made of crude Antimony with
fixt Nitre, described by Fr. Lana, in his Prodromus, p.
126. The 18th. Obs. Discovers the wonderful Texture
of the Root of the Perfoliata Alpina latif. min. Bauhini,
made up of many Membranes curiously complicated together; by which Signature he supposes it good for Ruptures, and the rather because another Species of Persoliata, by Chabreus called Auricula Leporis, has been used
with Success in that case. The 19th. Obs. is concerning a Spring, called Pliny's, and the River by the Inhabitants now named Torbidone; which Fountain in April,
Anno 1680. in a quarter of an hour rise three Inches
perpendicular, and sunk down again in half an hour's
time, repeating this Flood and Ebb alternately every
two hours; which Phaenomenon was observed not two
days, as is usually there thought, but only a few hours
before a shower of Rain. In the 20th. Obs. He shews
that the Musky smell coming from some Pismires and
Flies of Pisa, proceeds only from Sulphureous Particles
mixt with a Volatile Salt in the Dung of those little
Animals. In the 21st. He gives four Reasons why some
Plants are green all the Year. 1. From the abundance
of Oily Particles, as in Tansey, &amp;c. 2. A more Crass
and Viscous Substance, as in the Semper-vivum maj. &amp;c.
3. A very much interwoven texture of the Fibres of
the Leaves, as in Opuntia, Aloe Americana, &amp;c. 4. A
more hard and close outward Skin,with which the Leaves
are covered, as in the Laurus Alexandrina, Box, &amp;c.
The 22th. Obs. Describes a peculiar sort of Insect, which
he found on the Leaves of the Myrtus Tarentina at Rome,
</page>
<page id="36">
Anno 1678; they were of a grey colour, and a convex
figure, like the half of an Hempseed, and by the Microscope shewed scaley or plated like the Millipedes; being rub'd and bruised on a Paper, they gave it a curious
Purple colour, whence he conjectures they are a-kin to
the Cochinille Insect, which Paulus Ammannus in Manuduct ad Materiam Med. likens to the Cimices, and says,
that they are found on the Ficus Indica. In the 23d.
Obs. He adds some other Reasons of the continual greenness of some Plants, which, though defended with but a
thin Skin, yet resist the cold of the Winter, by reason
of its being of a like texture with that of a Man's,
which the Microscope discovers, and so is capable of affording the same defence; such are Arum, vulg. Brasica,
&amp;c. But some Plants, though of a solid texture, cannot endure the alterations of the Seasons, from the vehemence of the South Winds, and want of sufficient
Moisture in themselves. In the 24th. Obs. Several Prodigious Effects of Sulphureous Exhalations in divers
Parts of Italy, are related. In the 25th. Obs. He adds
some more thoughts concerning the Sal Ammoniac he
found on Iron-Scoria thrown up by AEtna in the Year
1669, to those he had formerly publish'd in Disquisit.
&amp; Observ. Physicis circa Corallium, &amp;c. Edit. Amst. p. 47.
Answering a Question proposed by Menzelius about the
Bononian Stone. Lastly, In the 26th. Obs. He asserts
the great Vertue of a Mineral Bezoar found in Sicily,
confirming it with the Cure of an Epidemick Fever in a
Virgin of Nineteen Years old, when all other Alexipharmicks had proved unsuccessful, provoking a considerable
Sweat, and throwing off the whole Cuticula; and shews
the reason of this Cure.
This Ingenious Searcher into Nature, not satisfied
with what he has already presented the Curious, in a
Letter dated at Palermo, Decemb. 4th. 1693. directed to
the Secretary of the Royal Society, promises in a short
</page>
<page id="37">
time to Publish another Book of 250 new Plants lately
gathered by himself in Sicily, graved on 120 Copper
Plates; of which the Title will be, Museo di Fisica e
di Esperienze, arrichito di Figure di Piante nove, Osservazione, Note Medicinali, e Ragionamenti, secondo i Principii
di Neoterici, disposito in Decade VIII.
In the same Letter he tells us, that the Lychnis Pseudomelanthio similis Affricanus glaber angusti-folius, Pauli
Hermans, is the same with the Lychnis Calyce duriori
Bocconi Ic. &amp; descr. Rar. Plant. The Stachis Betonicae
folio subincano P. Herman. is the Horminum Spicatum Lavendulae odore Bocconi: And that these with several other
rare Plants described by late Authors, are found frequently in Sicily.
He likewise Proposes a new Scorbutic Plant, which
from the Analogy of several external Notes and Characters he thinks may prove a very good Succedaneum,
where the Cochlearia folio subrotundo Casp. Bauhini is less
plentiful, viz. Thlaspi Leucoii folio latifolium platicarpos
Siculum, semper virens &amp; semper florens. This Plant having a very biting taste, a thick leaf, and smell like the
Cochlearia, confirms his Conjecture, besides the Generical Note of the Seed, the most certain Indication, and
sure Guide to discover the Qualities of unknown Plants,
according to Fabius Columna, and Andreas Caesalpinus.
This he submits to the Tryal of Physicians; observing
that they choose out amongst the several Species of the
Anagallis aquatica that called Anag. aqu. maj. folio subrotundo, C. B. Pin. possibly because of the Saline, Nitrous, and Acid Volatile Particles found in its Leaves,
which abound also in Scurvy-grass, and this Sicilian
Thlaspi.

II Lezioni intorno alla Natura delle Mosette,&amp;c.
Discourses concerning the Nature of Damps,
by Leonardus Capuanus, a Member of the
Academy of the Investigantes. Naples, in 4 to.
1683.
IN the Preface to this Treatise, the Son, who is the
Publisher thereof, gives us the History of the Beginning and Fate of the Academy of the Investigantes,
whereof his Father, the Author of this Book, was one,
in short, thus: Marquess Andreas Concubletti, after the
Example of the Royal and Florentine Societies, invited
the Learned Men of Naples to meet on certain days at
his House to Discourse of and to Cultivate Learning and
Knowledge; these assumed the Name of Investigantes,
with an Hound for their Impress, and Lucretius's word,
Vestigia lustrat, for their Motto. Scarce had this Society met four or five times, from which some promised
themselves great Matters, but it was again broken in
pieces, by the removal of the chief Person under whose
Protection they met. It was more than Twenty Years
before this Piece, containing some of the Lectures made
in that Assembly, were publish'd in Memory of the being of such a Society, and Dedicated to the Queen of
Sweden. In the first of these the Author enumerates
the chief Places that formerly, or at this day exhale a
noxious Vapour, treating largely of the Caves and Lakes
near Naples, Puzzuoli, Baiae, and Cumae, making the
Lake Avernus difser from these Damps, in that it is mischievous only to Birds, whereas the other are so to all
Creatures. Next, he gives the Opinions of the Old
and New Philosophers concerning the causes of these
Damps. In the Second Lecture, supposing Life to consist
</page>
<page id="39">
in the due Fermentation of the Blood, and other Juices
of the Body, he shews how necessary the Air is for the
continuing of Life, both in Plants and Animals, which
the former that want Lungs, do yet receive in Vessels
Analogous thereto; having shewn that a Vivifick
Spirit or Aura, generated out of the Blood by the Brain,
is the Principle of Motion in Animals; and that the dilating of the Thorax in breathing depends on this Aura
only, which by the direction of the Soul is sent into the
Nerves of all the Members, so causing Respiration
(which he makes a voluntary Action) and accompanies
the Air, received by the Vessels, to the Blood. In the
Third Lecture he Examines the several Effects of the
Caves exhaling these Damps, attempting to explain their
causes, viz. Lighted Torches are extinguisht by the
thick and compact Mineral Exhalations which oppose
the Particles giving or composing Fire, and compress
them so, that they are forced to give way, and are dissipated. That in Animals these Vapours rising by little
and little out of the Veins of the Earth, and united together in these Subterraneous Caverns, forcibly enter the
Organs of Respiration, and either wholly conquer or
drive out the Vivifick Aura, or at least so contract it,
and lessen its Power, as to stop the Motion of the Blood,
and indeed all other Motions, and Life it self. That
deadly Lakes kill only the Birds that fly over them, by
reason of the Mineral steams that from the bottom penetrating the Water, arise in a thin weakned Exhalation,
and Birds requiring a more refined and purer Air than
other Animals, are soonest affected by it. Then he Queries upon what Account Avernus, formerly from its
deadly Quality dedicated to pluto, is now so altered, as
to have been hurtless both to Fish and Birds for a long
time, and subscribes to their Opinion who refer the cause
to the burning of the adjacent Gaurus, now called Barbarus, and suppose that the Mortal Vapours formerly peF 2 netrating</page>
<page id="40">
netrating these Waters, are now burnt out. There are
several Curious and Learned Particulars interspersed in
this Treatise relating to Natural History, concerning
several Bodies hidden in the Bowels of the Earth, nearly
agreeing with those daily in our view.
