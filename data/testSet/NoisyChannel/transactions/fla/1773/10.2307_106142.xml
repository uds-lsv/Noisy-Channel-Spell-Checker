XIV. An Inquiry into the Quantity and Direction of the proper Motion of Arcturus;
with some Remarks on the Diminution of
the Obliquity of the Ecliptic: By Thomas Hornsby, M. A. Savilian Professor of
Astronomy in the University of Oxford,
and F. R. S.
AS an accurate knowledge of the
position of the fixed stars is of the
greatest importance, being the basis and foundation
of astronomy, it is no wonder that the astronomers
of different nations have given great attention to this
matter. By comparing antient with the best modern
observations, it appears that some of the fixed stars
have a proper motion, independent of any motion
hitherto known in our own system; or that, in other
words, the angular distances of the fixed stars have
not always continued the same, and in some of them
the alteration is so very considerable as to be easily
perceived in the course of a few years, with instruments accurately made, and nicely adjusted. Of all
the stars visible in our hemisphere, the variation in
the place of Arcturus is the most remarkable, and
such as cannot possibly be attributed to the uncertainty of observation. It has accordingly been taken no6 tice

tice of by many astronomers: in particular, Dr. Halley mentions it in No 355 of the Philosophical Transactions: Mr. Cassini, in the Memoirs of the Academy of Sciences for 1738, p. 231, has shewn, that
there is a variation of five minutes in the latitude of
that star between his own time and that of Tycho,
in an interval of a century and a half: and M. le
Monnier, in the Memoirs of the Academy of Sciences
for 1767, p. 417, proves, that the latitude of Arcturus
varies at the rate of two seconds every year; and that
the longitude decreases at the rate of 60~ in a hundred years *. But as an inquiry as well into the true
quantity as into the direction of this motion has not
hitherto been made public, I propose to give some
account of my own observations made expressly with
this view in the years 1767 and 1768, with a transit
instrument of 44 inches, and a moveable mural quadrant of 33 inches, both constructed by Mr. Bird,
and of the conclusions resulting from a comparison
between them and some observations made by Mr.
Flamsteed in 1690.
It may perhaps be objected, that the differences of
right ascension, as determined by Mr. Flamsteed's
mural instrument, are not to be depended upon from
the very nature of his instrument. Mr. Flamsteed
was himself too good an observer not to be aware of
this; and accordingly in the Prolegomena to the
third volume of the Historia Caelestis, p. 132, he informs us in what manner he determined the error of

1769, p. 21. See also Astronomiae Fundamenta, by the Abbe
de la Caille; who, in reducing his observations of Arcturus,

the plane at different distances from the zenith. By
distributing these errors in the best manner I could,
I am of opinion, that the error of the plane of his instrument may be supposed to decrease uniformly at
the rate of half a second in time for every degree of
zenith distance from 28~ to 60~, the error being 39~
at the former, and 23~ at the latter, by which quantity stars passed the horary wire, in his instrument, before
they came to the true meridian. It should seem also
that the error continued nearly the same from 60 to
75 degrees, being at the latter only 22~: but that
it decreased irregularly from 75~ to 85~, viz. 1~ in
time for each degree from 75~ to 80~, and 0~, 4 for
each degree from 80~ to 85 degrees. The mural arc
was fixed upon a stone pier, the southern part of
which was found to settle yearly, from whence the
error of the line of collimation to the south necessarily became every successive year greater and greater.
As Mr. Flamsteed seems not to have had any method
of adjusting his instrument by a plumb-line, these errors must have been irregular at different seasons of
the same year, and were perhaps never truly determined. But as the observations here referred to were
made on the same day, and within the compass of
an hour, they are probably not affected with this latter error. We are at present concerned with the difference of two zenith distances, and not with the absolute quantity of those zenith distances. The conclusions may indeed be affected with an error in the
divisions; and from the examination which I
have been able to make, I am of opinion that the
arc of Mr. Flamsteed's instrument was not of the
proper quantity; and that, though the observations
</page>
<page id="96">
generally erred in defect, they in some parts erred
in excess.
On the 14th of February, 1690, Mr. Flamsteed
observed, that a small star, of the seventh or eighth
magnitude, whose place is not determined in the
British catalogue, and which star was named by him
Infra Arcturum, preceded Arcturus three seconds in
time, or 3~, 3, when an allowance is made for the
error of the plane of the instrument= 0~ 42~, 6, and
was 26~ 30~ to the south of Arcturus *. By a mean
of eight observations made at Oxford, on and near
June the 10th, 1767, with the transit instrument,
and with a refracting telescope of eight feet, furnished with a micrometer; the difference of right ascension was 1~, 8~, 75 of a degree, the star following
Arcturus; and by a mean of three observations,
the extremes differing only 3~, the small star was
23~ 55~, 0 to the south of Arcturus.
The right ascension of Arcturus and the small star
being nearly the same, the change in declination
ought to be so likewise. But, from the observed
difference in declination, the right ascension of the
two stars must vary unequally, though with a very
small difference. Accordingly it appears from computation (in which the annual precession is supposed
= 50~, 35, the obliquity of the ecliptic at the middle of the interval of the time = 23~ 28~ 30~,
and the right ascensions and declinations of the two
stars taken at a mean between the times of observation) that the variation of Arcturus in right ascension
was 3270~, 6, and of the small star 3277~, 6 in
* This is the only observation of that star made by Mr.
Flamsteed.

<page id="97">
77,287 years. Therefore the right ascension of Arcturus alters less than that of the star; and consequently Arcturus should in 1767 have followed the
star by 42~,6. But the star was observed to follow
Arcturus by 1~ 8~, 75. The right ascension therefore of Arcturus has increased less than that of the
star, or Arcturus has moved westward 1~ 51~, 35 in
77,287 years; and has gone southward 2~ 35~ in
the same time, supposing the small star not to have
moved, which is highly probable.
On the same day the difference of right ascension
in time between the star n Bootis and Arcturus was
21~ 32~ of mean solar time, = 5~ 24~ 02~, 2, when a
proper allowance is made for the going of the clock,
and for the error of the plane of the instrument;
and the difference of declination was 50~ 45~, 6,
when an allowance is made for refraction. On the
24th, 26th, and 29th of May, and the 9th of June,
of the year 1768, I determined the difference in
right ascension to be 21~ 27~ of sidereal time by the
two former observations, and 21~ 263/4~ by the two
latter, the difference in declination being 49~ 48~, 7,
by a mean of the observations in May, the extremes
differing only four seconds. It appears from computation, that between the times of observation the variation of n Bootis in right ascension was 3371~, 7,
and 1417~, 3, in declination; of Arcturus 3311~, 7
in right ascension, and 1347~, 9 in declination: The
difference of variation in right ascension is 1~ 0~,
and of declination 1~ 9~, 4; by the former the difference in right ascension was diminished, and in declination increased by the latter, agreeably to the places
of the two stars. The difference in right ascension
</page>
<page id="98">
therefore in 1768, if neither of the stars had moved,
should have been = 5~ 23~ 02~, 2, and 51~ 55~ in
declination; but they were observed to be 5~ 21~
43~, 4, and 49~ 48~, 7. Arcturus therefore by this
observation has in 78,257 years gone 1~ 18~, 8 to the
west, and 2~ 06~, 3 to the south, supposing n Bootis not
to have any proper motion.
On the 5th of April, 1691, the difference in right
ascension between n Bootis and Arcturus was
21~ 33~ of mean solar time, = 5~ 24~ 14~, 0; and
the difference of declination 50~ 45~, 6, as in the
preceding example. The difference of variation in
right ascension is 59~, 1, and in declination 1~ 8~, 4~
The difference of right ascension therefore at the latter end of May, 1768, should have been 5~ 23~ 14~, 9,
and 51~ 54~, 0 in declination; but, according to
observation, they were 5~ 21~ 43~, 4, and 49~ 48~, 7.
Arcturus therefore, according to this observation, has
moved 1~ 31~, 5 to the west, and 2~ 05~, 3 to the
south in 77, 120 years.
On the 4th of May, 1691, the difference of right
ascension between n Bootis and Arcturus was 21~ 33~
of mean solar time, = 5~ 24~ 14~, 3 when allowance is made for the going of the clock and the error of the plane of the instrument, and the difference
of declination on the 3d of May = 50~ 50~, 6.
According to computation, those differences should
have been 5~ 23~ 15~, 2 and 51~ 59~, 0 respectively; but they were observed to be 5~ 21~ 43~, 4,
and 49~ 48~, 7. Arcturus therefore in 77,071 years
has moved 1~ 31~, 8 westward, and 2~ 10~, 3
southward. N. B. The zenith-distance of Arcturus,
as
</page>
<page id="99">
as determined by Mr. Flamsteed, on the 4th of May,
is manifestly erroneous.
On the 27th of May, 1692, n Bootis preceded
Arcturus in right ascension by 21~ 32~, 5 of mean
solar time, = 5~ 24~ 10~, 1, the difference of declination being 50~ 50~, 6. In 75,978 years the
difference of right ascension should have been
5~ 23~ 11~, 8 and 51~ 58~, 0 in declination; but
those differences were observed to be 5~ 21~ 43~, 4
and 49~ 48~, 7. Arcturus therefore has moved 1~ 28~, 4
westward, and 2~ 09~, 3 southward.
On the 27th of May, 1692, Arcturus preceded
~ Bootis in right ascension by 24~ 35~, 5 of mean
solar time, = 6~ 9~ 32~, 2, when an allowance is
made for the going of the clock and the error of the
plane of the instrument, the difference of declination
being 3~ 2~ 28~, 9. On the 24th and 26th of May,
and 5th of June, 1768, the difference of right ascension between the same stars observed at Oxford was
24~ 44~, 58 of sidereal time, = 6~ 11~ 9~, 1, the
difference of declination being 2~ 58~ 24~, 2. In
1768, the difference of right ascension should have
been 2~, 7 greater, = 6~ 9~ 34~, 9; and the difference of declination 1~ 31~, 7 less, = 3~ 0~ 57~, 2.
But they were observed to be 6~ 11~ 9~, 1, and
2~ 58~ 24~, 2. Arcturus therefore in 75,978 years
has, by a comparison with this star, moved 1~ 34~, 2
westward, and 2~ 33~, 0 southward.
Again, the difference of declination between Arcturus and ~ Bootis was observed to be 3~ 2~ 33~, 9
on the 14th of February, 1690, when the difference
of right ascension between these two stars was not
observed by Mr. Flamsteed. It appears by compuO 2 tation,</page>
<page id="100">
tation, that the difference of variation in declination
between the times of observation was 1~ 34~, 5, by
which quantity the difference of declination was diminished, and should therefore in 1768 have been
3~ 0~ 59~, 4. But it was 2~ 58~ 24~, 2 by actual
observation. Arcturus therefore by this observation
has moved southward 2~ 35~, 2 in 78,255 years.
By the foregoing comparisons Arcturus appears to
have moved as in the following table.

As the quantity of the motion of Arcturus southward in declination, as deduced from a comparison
with n Bootis, differs considerably from the quantities given by the small star and ~ Bootis, which agree
very nearly together, I have compared n Bootis with
some of the neighbouring stars, as that star, though
of the third magnitude only, may have a small motion
of its own.
On the 14th of February, 1690, the difference of
declination between n and ~ Bootis was observed by
Mr. Flamsteed to be = 2~, 1~ 47~, 8. By computation, that difference in 1768 should have been
2~ 43~, 9 less, = 2~ 9~ 3~, 9: but it was actually
</page>
<page id="101">
observed to be 2~ 8~ 34~, 3 only. The star n Bootis
therefore appears by this comparison to have moved
southward 29~, 6 in 78,257 years.
On the 27th of May, 1692, n Bootis was observed
by Mr. Flamsteed to be 2~ 11~ 37~, 8 to the north of
~ Bootis, which quantity should by computation be
2~ 39~, 1 less in 1768, or 2~ 8~ 58~, 7. But it was
found to be 2~ 8~ 34~, 3. The star n therefore appears to have moved southward 0~ 24~, 4 in 75,978
years.
On the 25th of April, 1693, n Bootis was observed
to be 40~ 20~, 8 to the south of f Bootis, a star of
the 6th magnitude; and by myself that difference
was observed to be 42~ 37~, 5, by taking the mean
of two observations on the 24th and 26th of May,
1768, differing only 4~, 7. According to computation, the variation of n Bootis in declination during the
interval of the two observations was 1359~, 3, and
of f Bootis 1256~, 0; and therefore the difference of
variation in declination was 1~ 43~, 3, by which the
distance of the stars was increased. The difference
in declination therefore in 1768, if neither of the
stars moved, should have been 0~ 42~ 04~, 1; but it
was observed to be 33~, 4 greater, by which quantity
therefore n Bootis must have moved southward in
75,052 years.
By reducing all the foregoing deductions to 78
years, Arcturus appears to have moved,

As Arcturus appears to have moved southward of
n Bootis 2~ 9~, 31, by taking a mean of the four
quantities resulting from the comparisons with that
star; and as n Bootis has also moved southward of
some of the neighbouring small stars by 29~, 755 in
the same time, Arcturus upon the whole has moved
2~ 39~ 06 to the south, by the comparisons with
n Bootis only; and therefore, by taking a mean of
all the results, Arcturus has altered its right ascension less than the neighbouring stars by 1~ 33~, 97 in
78 years, in which time it has also moved 2~ 36~, 81
to the south of the same stars.
In order to see how far the motion of right ascension is to be depended upon, which is deduced from
the above comparisons, I have selected and computed the following observations, made at Shirburn

castle with a transit instrument of 51/4 feet, placed
exactly in the plane of the meridian, and consequently more to be relied upon than those made
with a mural instrument.
By a mean of five observations, made on the 7th,
12th, 23d, 24th, and 31st of May, 1741, O. S.
the difference in right ascension between n Bootis and
Arcturus was 5~ 22~ 38~, 9, the extremes differing
only 4~, 4 of a degree. The difference in the variation of right ascension to the end of May, 1768, is
20~, 5, by which the ascensional difference is diminished. It should therefore have been 5~ 22~ 18~, 4;
but it was observed to be 5~ 21~ 43~, 4. Therefore
in 27 years Arcturus has moved westward 35~, 0.
On the 16th and 20th of May, 1744, the difference in right ascension between n Bootis and Arcturus was 5~ 22~ 30~, 0 by each of the observations,
which difference should have been, supposing neither
of the stars to have any proper motion, 5~ 22~ 11~, 7
in May, 1768. But it was found to be 28~, 3 less;
by so much therefore had Arcturus moved westward
in 24 years.
On the 24th of May, and 8th of June, 1746, the
difference in right ascension between the same stars
was 5~ 22~ 26~, 2, by taking a mean of the two
observations; that difference should have been
5~ 22~ 09~, 5 in 1768. But it was observed
= 5~ 21~ 43~, 4. Arcturus therefore in 22 years has
moved 26~, 1 to the west.
Lastly; on the 16th of April, and 27th and 28th
of May, 1747, the difference in right ascension between n Bootis and Arcturus, by taking a mean of
the three observations, was 5~ 22~ 25~, 0. By computation</page>
<page id="104">
putation the variation in the difference of right ascension was 16~, 0, by which the ascensional difference should have been diminished, and = 5~ 22~ 09~, 0.
But by observation it was found = 5~ 21~ 43~, 4:
Arcturus therefore by this last observation appears to
have gone 25,6,'' westward.
By the observations therefore at Shirburn Castle
Arcturus appears to have gone westward as in the
following table; in the last column of which are
contained the quantities resulting from the observations of each year, reduced to 78 years.

Mean 1 35,14
The mean of all the observations, when reduced
to an interval of 78 years, is 1~ 35~, 14, which differs only 1~, 17 from the mean of the other comparisons.
As then the proper motions of Arcturus westward
in right ascension = 1~ 33~, 974, and 2~ 36~, 81 in declination southward, seem well established, the real
motion of Arcturus is inclined in an angle of 30~ 56~
to the west of the meridian or horary circle, and to be
in that direction 3~ 2~, 81 in 78 years, or at the
rate of 2~, 343 in a year. As this direction of its
motion is nearly perpendicular to the plane of the
ecliptic, the latitude of Arcturus must diminish yearly
almost in the same proportion; and its longitude will
alter less than that of other stars, though not so considerably as its right ascension.
</page>
<page id="105">
The proper motion of Arcturus then, in right
ascension Westward, being 1~, 205, and in declination 2~, 005, its annual precession in right ascension
is 41~, 108, and in declination 19~, 133; and the
true right ascension of Arcturus, on Jan. 1, 1773,
is 211~ 19~ 47~, 4, and declination North
20~ 22~ 23~, 3.
As none of the other principal stars have been
found to have a motion so considerable as this,
though many of the stars of the first magnitude, as
for instance, Sirius, Procyon, ~ Aquilae, ~ Orionis,
as also ~ Aquilae of inferior magnitude, do really
vary their positions (and perhaps all of the first order
will hereafter be found to have a proper motion), we
may, I think, fairly conclude that Arcturus is the
nearest star to our system, visible in this hemisphere.
If therefore the annual parallax of the fixed stars can
ever be discovered, that is, if the diameter of the
annual orbit bear a sensible proportion to the distance
of the nearest fixed star, it is most likely to be discovered from the observations of Arcturus. The
system of the world, considered in an enlarged sense,
and agreeable to the idea we may entertain of an allpowerful benevolent Creator, may be taken to occupy the whole-abyss of space, and to consist of an
assemblage of bodies, having different magnitudes,
and emitting various degrees and modifications of
light. The apparent change of situation visible from
the planet which we inhabit, and which revolves round
one of the great bodies constituting a part of the general system, as a center, may be owing either to
the motion of our own system in absolute space, or,
if our system should be at rest, to a real motion in
</page>
<page id="106">
the stars themselves: from whence the angular
distances of the stars must vary in proportion to the
velocity of those motions, or to the direction of those
motions with respect to ourselves. I have reason,
at present, to believe that a small motion may be
discovered in the star o Ceti, and perhaps in other
stars that vary in degrees of brightness, which the
diligence of future astronomers will discover, and
perhaps in less time than at first sight might seem necessary, when we consider the several improvements
which have of late been made in the methods of observing the heavenly bodies.
As the motion of Arcturus in declination (the
quantity of which we have thus endeavoured to ascertain) has been often acknowledged, it is matter
of wonder that some astronomers, by comparing
either the altitude or zenith distance of the Sun's limb
with Arcturus, without previously settling the quantity
of that star's motion in declination, or at least doing
it indirectly, should endeavour to determine whether the obliquity of the ecliptic hath remained constant, or still continues to diminish, as it should seem,
to have done for many centuries past, from the observations of successive astronomers. Mr. Cassini, and
Mr. le Monnier, have both practised this method,
and are of opinion, that the obliquity of the ecliptic
hath not altered; or, if it hath altered, that the
quantity of its alteration is not near so considerable
as hath been imagined by some celebrated astronomers. By observing for several days before and after
the solstice the altitude or zenith distance of the
Sun's limb, and that of a star situated near the same
parallel, the differences to be remarked in process of
</page>
<page id="107">
time in the distances of the Sun from that star (the
motion of the star in declination being allowed for
during that interval of time), will be the quantity
by which the Sun will have approached to or have
receded from the star. If the star were absolutely a
fixed point, and the observations sufficiently numerous, that, by taking a mean, the necessary and
unavoidable errors in observation might either be
considerably diminished or almost annihilated, the
method might be practised to great advantage. But
as the star (Arcturus) had a proper motion, and its
apparent place was continually varying from the effect
of the nutation of the earth's axis; as the limb of
the Sun was sometimes approaching to, and sometimes receding from, the star, by a kind of libratory
motion from the effect of the nutation; also and as
the obliquity of the ecliptic itself was, in all probability, continually diminishing; from a combination
and as it were involution of these motions no certain conclusion could be drawn, since, in the space of
a few years, the apparent obliquity may be the same,
and yet the mean obliquity may have diminished,
or perhaps, in the space of a few years, the obliquity
may appear to have increased, when it may really
have become less. Whereas, by reducing the observations to their mean position, and by assigning to
each known cause its proper and allowed effect, a
regularity and uniformity must necessarily take place,
as far at least as is consistent with the unavoidable
errors in observing.
Mr. Cassini, in the Memoirs of the Academy of
Sciences for 1767, acquaints us, that, in 1748, the
apparent distance of Arcturus from the upper limb

vations made with the gnomon of St. Sulpice, and
communicated by Mr. le Monnier, in the same volume, it should seem that that astronomer is of opinion, that the obliquity of the ecliptic hath no other
variation than what the nutation of the earth's axis
will occasion; and that therefore we must either
abandon the absolute diminution of the ecliptic, or
at least suppose it extremely small, since, in the space
of eighteen years, it hath not produced a sensible
alteration.

As the result of the observations only, and not the
observations themselves, are communicated, I have
only to observe, that there is a very considerable difference between the conclusions of the two astronomers for the same year 1763, and, at the same time,
to declare my suspicion, that if the apparent (for such
I apprehend them to be) were reduced to the mean
distances, they would probably afford a confirmation
of the diminution of the ecliptic. For the following
observations of the Sun's zenith distance, made at
Shirburn Castle, near the summer solstices of the
years 1743, 1746, 1748, and 1766, and of Arcturus in the years 1743, 1746, and 1766, when reduced to their mean state at the solstice, do not confirm the assertion of Mr. Cassini, but are an evident
</page>
<page id="110">
and absolute proof that the obliquity of the ecliptic
has sensibly diminished during an interval of 23, and
even of 18 years.
The observations of 1743 were made with a mural quadrant of five French feet, constructed by the
late Mr. Sisson: but as the linear divisions were
found to be somewhat less accurate than was
expected, and as the body of the quadrant was not
framed with proper strength and solidity, Mr. Bird
was employed in the summer of the year 1745, by
the Earl of Macclesfield, (the body of the instrument
having been strengthened by screwing a large and
broad plate of brass upon the cross-bars), to put a set of
points upon the limb between the 90 and 96 arches
of linear divisions. By these operations the line of
collimation was found to have varied, and to be
= 6~,3, by which the zenith distances were given
too small, by the positive divisions, from the end of
1746 to the end of June 1751, when Mr. Bird bisected the spaces between the points which he had
formerly added in 1745. But after the year 1751,
the error of the line of collimation was = 2~,6, as
appears from observations of ~ Persei, ~ and ~ Draconis, by which the zenith distances are also given
too small; and in that state the instrument continued
to the year 1767, when a new set of wires was put
into the telescope, and the line of collimation thereby
altered. The error of the line of collimation from
1743 to 1745 cannot directly be ascertained, for
want of zenith observations; but, from some indirect
methods, it should seem that the error was as nearly
as possible = 2~, to be added to the observed zenith
distances.

From the foregoing observations, it appears that
the mean solstitial zenith distance in summer was as

1746. 28 11 4,1 62,5
1748. 28 11 4,1 69,4

And, by comparing the three former with the
latter, the variation of the obliquity of the ecliptic in
100 years is as is expressed in the last column of the
table.
By comparing the distance of Arcturus from the
center of the Sun in 1743, with the same distance as
observed in 1766 (an allowance being made for the
proper motion of the star during the interval, as also
for its variation in declination arising from the precession
</page>
<page id="115">
cession of the equinoxes), it appears that its distance
is 17~,3 less than it would have been, if the distance
of the Sun's center from the equator had remained
unvaried. By that quantity, therefore, the obliquity
of the ecliptic has altered in 23 years; which is at
the rate of 75~,2 in 100 years.
By comparing, in like manner, the distance in
1746, the obliquity of the ecliptic has diminished
15~,6 in 20 years, or 78~ in 100 years.

Variation of obliquity.... 17,3 15,6
The foregoing deductions prove, I think, beyond all doubt, that the obliquity has become less;
but as the interval of time between the two terms of
comparison is so short, that the errors committed in
observing may bear a sensible proportion to the small
quantities just now found, and which, perhaps, are
somewhat too large; let us have recourse to Mr.
Flamsteed's observations, and compare them with
observations made by myself, in the course of the last
and present years. For this purpose, I have reduced all
the observations of the Sun, made in 1690, from
May 26 to June 24, O. S. and also all the observations of Arcturus, made in the same year, to their
mean position at the summer solstice of that year.
The observations, together with my own made at
Oxford, are as follows.
</page>
<page id="121">
From the foregoing observations it appears that,
at the summer solstice of the year 1690, Arcturus
was 2~ 40~ 12~,8 to the South of the Sun's center
in declination: the motion of the star, in declination,
from that time to the summer solstice of the year
1772, including its proper motion, is 26~ 16~,4.
Arcturus, therefore, in 1772, should have been
3~ 6~ 29~,2 to the South of the Sun's center, if the
angle of the ecliptic and equator had not varied:
but that distance was found by actual observation to
be 51~,6 less. By so much therefore must the obliquity of the ecliptic have become less in an interval
of 82 years; and, consequently, the variation in
100 years will be 62~,92.
If the observations of Arcturus be reduced to the
solstice of 1771, and the zenith distance of the Sun's
center, as observed in that year, be made use of in
the same manner, the variation of the obliquity in
81 years will be found = 48~,8, and in 100 years
= 60~.
If the quantity of the arc of Mr. Flamsteed's instrument were accurately known, the observations
which he made at the winter solstice in 1690 might
be compared with later observations, in order to determine both the quantity of the obliquity in 1690,
and also the variation since his time. Accordingly,
I have endeavoured to determine the error of the arc
of the instrument between 28~ and 75~ of zenith
distance, and proceeded in the following manner.
I computed several observations of the stars ~ Tauri,
~ Pleiadum, ~ and ~ Geminorum, and ~, ~, and
~ Sagittarii, as observed by Mr. Flamsteed, in the
years 1690, 1691, and 1692, and reducing them
</page>
<page id="122">
to the years 1760 and 1766, I compared the differences of declination between those stars, resulting
from Mr. Flamsteed's observations, with the differences given by the places of the same stars, as
settled by Dr. Bradley in 1760, and also by actual
observations of the same stars made at ShirburnCastle in 1766; and, by combining these differences
together, I found that the whole arc of 90 degrees
was too short by 43~. Supposing the error to be uniform, the proportional part of this quantity, thus
found for the solstitial zenith distance of the Sun in
June = 13~,4, is nearly confirmed upon the authority of Mr. Flamsteed himself, who, in the prolegomena to the third volume of the Historia Caelestis,
where he is deducing the latitude of the Royal Observatory at Greenwich, and the quantity of the obliquity in 1690, from his own observations, allows
the zenith distances at 28~, 36~, and 40~, on his instrument, to be too small by 15~ and by 20~,
at 75~.
I have therefore computed the observations of the
Sun, made from November 30 to December 20
of 1690, which, reduced to the solstice, are as in
the following table; to which are subjoined the observations made by myself at Oxford, at the winter
solstice of 1771.

By commparing the observations at the summer
solstices of 1771 and 1772 with those at the winter
solstice of 1771, it appears that the mean obliquity was about the beginning of the year 1772
= 23~ 28~ 9~,4 and 23~ 28~ 8~. I suppose therefore the mean obliquity to be 23~ 28~ 8~ at the
beginning of the present year; and consequently,
the obliquity has diminished, by my observations,
47~ in 81 years, since Mr. Flamsteed's time, or at
the rate of 58~ in 100 years, a quantity which will
be found nearly at a mean of the computations
framed by Mr. Euler and Mr. de la Lande, upon
the principles of attraction.
