THE Book consists of three Parts. In the first,
called Logometria, the Author's chief Design is
to shew how that sort of Problems, which are usually
reduced to the Quadrature of the Hyperbola and Ellipsis, may be reduced to the the Measures of Ratio's
and Angles; and afterwards be solved more readily
by the Canons of Logarithms and Sines and Tangents.
He defines the Measures of Ratio's to be quantities of
any kind, whose Magnitudes are analogous to the
Magnitudes of the Ratio's to be measured. In this
Sense any Canon of Logarithms is a System of numeral Measures of the Ratio's of the absolute Numbers to
an Unit: The Parts of the Asymptote of the Logistic
Line, intercepted between its Ordinates, are a System
of Linear Measures of the Ratio's of those Ordinates:
The Areas of an Hyperbola, intercepted between its
Ordinates to the Asymptote, are a System of Plane
Measures of the Ratio's of those Ordinates: And since
there may be infinite Systems of Measures according
</page>
<page id="140">
as various kinds of Quantities are made use of, such as
Numbers, Time, Velocity, and the like; or according as the Measures of any one System may be all increased or diminished in any given proportion; in such
Variety much Confusion may possibly arise as to the
Kind and absolute Magnitudes of particular Measures,
which happen to fall under Consideration. Our Author very happily removes this Difficulty; by shewing that the Nature of the Subject points out the Measure of a certain immutable Ratio for a Modulus in all
Systems, whereby to determine the Kind and absolute
Magnitudes of all other Measures in each System.
The first Proposition is to find the Measure of any
proposed Ratio. This he considers in a way so simple
and general, as naturally leads to the Notion and Definition of a Modulus; namely,that it is an invariable
Quantity in each System, which bears the same Proportion to the Increment of the Measure of any proposed Ratio, as the increasing Term of the Ratio bears
to its own Increment. He then shews, that the Measure of any given Ratio is as the Modulus of the System, from whence it is taken: and that the Modulus
in every System is always equal to the Measure of a
certain determinate and immutable Ratio, which he
therefore calls the Ratio Modularis. He shews that
this Ratio is expressed by these Numbers 2,7182818
&amp;c. to 1, or by 1 to 0,3678794 &amp;c. So that in
Briggs's Canon the Logarithm of this Ratio is the
Modulus of that System: In the Logistic Line the
given Subtangent is the Modulus of that System: In
the Hyperbola the given Parallelogram, contained by
an Ordinate to the Asymptote and the Absciss from
the Center, is the Modulus of that System: and in
other Systems the Modulus is generally some remarkable Quantity. In the second Proposition he gives a
</page>
<page id="141">
concise uncommon Method for calculating Briggs's
Canon of Logarithms; together with Rules for finding
intermediate Logarithms and Numbers, even beyond
the Limits of the Canon. In the 3d Proposition he
constructs any System of Measures by a Canon of Logarithms; not only when the Measure of some one
Ratio is given, but also without that Datum, by seeking
the Modulus of the System by the Rule abovementioned. In the 4th, 5th, and 6th Propositions he
squares the Hyperbola, describes the Logistic Line and
AEquiangular Spiral by a Canon of Logarithms, and
shews some curious Uses of these Propositions in their
Scholia. Take an easy Example of the Logometrical
Method, in the common Problem for finding the Density of the Atmosphaere. Supposing Gravity uniform,
every one knows, that if Altitudes are taken in any Arithmetical Progression, the Densities of the Air in
those Altitudes will be in a Geometrical Progression;
that is, the Altitudes are the Measures of the Ratio's
of the Densities below and in those Altitudes, and so
the difference of any two Altitudes is the Measure of
the Ratio of the Densities in those Altitudes. Now
to determine the absolute or real Magnitude of these
Measures, the Author shews, a priori, that the Modulus of the System is the Altitude of the Atmosphaere, when reduced every where to the same Density
as below. The Modulus therefore is given (as bearing the same Proportion to the Altitude of the Mercury in the Barometer, as the specific Gravity of Mercury does to the specifick Gravity of Air) and consequently the whole System is given. For since in all
Systems the Measures of the same Ratio's are analogous among themselves; the Logarithm of the Ratio
of the Air's Density in any two Altitudes will be to the
Modulus of the Canon, (that is, to the Logarithm of
</page>
<page id="142">
the Ratio Modularis defined above,) as the difference
of those Altitudes is to the aforesaid given Altitude of
the homogeneous Atmosphaere.
He concludes the Logometria with a General Scholium, containing great Variety of elegant Constructions both Logometrical and Trigonometrical; such
as give the Length of Curves either Geometrical or
Mechanical; their Area's and Centers of Gravity;
the Solids generated from them, and the Surfaces of
these Solids; together with several curious Problems in Natural Philosophy, concerning the Attraction of Bodies, the Density and Resistance of
Fluids, and the Trajectories of Planets. Several of
these Problems have two Cases; one constructed by
the Measure of a Ratio, and the other by the Measure
of an Angle. The great Affinity and beautiful Harmony of the Measures in these Cases, has given occasion to the Title of the Book. The Measures of
Angles are defined (just as the Measures of Ratio's) to
be Quantities of any Kind, whose Magnitudes are
analogous to the Magnitudes of the Angles. Such may
be the Arcs or Sectors of any Circle, or any other
Quantities of Time, Velocity, or Resistance, analogous to the Magnitudes of the Angles. Every System of these Measures has likewise its Modulus homogeneous to the Measures in that System, <inferred>and</inferred> may be
computed by the Trigonometrical Canon of Sines and
Tangents, just as the Measures of Ratio's by the Canon of Logarithms; for the given Modulus in each
System bears the same Proportion to the Measure of
any given Angle, as the Radius of a Circle bears to an
Arc which subtends that Angle, or the same as this
constant Number of Degrees 57,2957795130 bears to
the Number of Degrees in the said Angle. Upon the
whole our Author thus expresses himself, p. 35. ``
</page>
<page id="143">
Why the Author takes his Principles to be so general, will farther appear by an Instance or two. In the
Problem already mentioned he measures the Ratio of
the Air's Densities in any Altitudes, by the Altitudes
themselves, making use of the Altitude of an uniform
Atmosphaere for the Modulus. So likewise when he
considers the Velocities acquired, and the Spaces described in given Times, by a Body projected upwards
or downwards in a resisting Medium with any given
Velocity; he shews, that the Times of Descent, added
</page>
<page id="144">
to a given Time, are the Measures of Ratio's, to a
given Modulus of Time, whose Terms are the Sum
and Difference of the ultimate Velocity and
the present Velocities that are acquired: that
the Times of Ascent, taken from a given Time,
are the Measures of Angles, to a given Modulus of Time, whose Radius is to their Tangents in the
Ratio of the ultimate Velocity to the present Velocities: and lastly, that the Spaces described in Descent or Ascent, are the Measures of Ratio's to a given
Modulus of Space, whose Terms are the absolute accelerating and retarding Forces arising from Gravity and
Resistance taken together at the Beginning and End of
those Spaces.
This general Account may suffice to illustrate what
I am going to say; that since the Magnitudes of Ratio's (as well as their Terms) may be expounded by
Quantities of any Kind, the Mathematician is at Liberty upon all Occasions to chuse those which are fittest for his Purpose; and such are they without doubt,
that are put into his Hand by the Conditions of the
Problem. He may indeed represent these Quantities
by an Hyperbola, or any other Logometrical System,
were not his Purpose answer'd with greater Simplicity
by the very System itself, which occurs in each particular Problem. And the same may be said for the Systems of Angular Measures, instead of recurring upon
all Occasions to Elliptical or Circular Area's.
As to the Convenience of calculating from our Author's Constructions, he shews that the Measures of
any Ratio's or Angles are always computed in the
same uniform Way; by taking from the Tables the
Logarithm of the Ratio, or the Number of Degrees in
the Angle, and then by finding a fourth Proportional
to three given Quantities; for that will be the Measure
</page>
<page id="145">
required. The simplest Hyperbolic Area may indeed
be squared by the same Operation taught in the Author's fourth Proposition; but the simplest Elliptic Area requires somewhat more: Those that are more
complex in both Kinds (which generally happens) require an additional Trouble to reduce them to the simplest: to square them by infinite Series is still more
operose, and does not answer the End of Geometry.
Upon the whole therefore it may deserve to be considered, for what Purposes should Problems be always
constructed by Conic Areas, unless it be to please or
assist the Imagination. The Design of Theoretical
Geometry differs from Problematical; the former consists in the Discovery and Contemplation of the Properties and Relations of Figures for the sake of naked
Truth; but the Design of the latter is to do something
proposed, and is best executed by the least Apparatus of
the former.
The Logometria was first published by the Author
himself, in the Philosoph. Transact. of the Year 1714.
No 338. But his Logometrical and Trigonometrical
Theorems abovementioned were not published till after
his Decease. These Theorems make the second Part
of the Book, and are calculated to give the Fluents of
Fluxions (reduced to 18 Forms) by Measures of Ratio's
and Angles; in such a manner, that any Person may
perfectly comprehend their Construction and Use,
though altogether unacquainted with Curvilinear
Figures, as expressed by AEquations. And this Circumstance does also render the Application of them
to the Analysis and Construction of Problems extremely easy. Of this kind the Author has given a
great many choice Examples both in abstract and physical Problems; which make up the third and last Part
of the Book.

<page id="146">
The Author, a little before his Decease has informed
us (in a Letter of May 5. wrote to his Friend Mr. Jones)
that Geometers had not yet promoted the inverse
Method of Fluxions, by Conic Areas, or by Measures of Ratio's and Angles, so far as it is capable of
being promoted by those Methods. There is an
infinite Field (says he) still reserved, which it has
been my Fortune to find an Entrance into. Not to
keep you longer in Suspense, I have found out a general and beautiful Method by Measures of Ratio's
and Angles for the Fluent of any Quantity which
can come under this Form dzz~n+ ~/~ n 1/e +fz n, in
which d, e, f are any constant Quantities, z the variable,n any Index, ~ any whole Number affirmative or
negative, ~ any Fraction whatever. The Fluents of
this Form which have hitherto been considered are
dzz~n 1/e +fzn &amp; dzz~n+ 1/2 n 1/e +fz n: These you remember are Sir Isaac Newton's two first, and from
these all his others are easily deduced. And as his
irrational Forms of the quadratick Kind are derived
from the rational, so from my general rational
Form I deduce irrational ones of all Kinds. For instance, if ~ represent any affirmative or negative
Fraction, the Fluent of any Quantity of this Form
dzz~n1~e+fzn~ ~, or of this dzz~n1
~e+fz n/g +hzn~~ and so of some others, depends upon
</page>
<page id="147">
the Measures of Ratio's and Angles. Mr. Leibnitz
in the Leipsic Acts of 1702, p. 218 and 219, has very rashly undertaken to demonstrate, that the Fluent
of x/x4 + a4 cannot be expressed by Measures of Ratio's and Angles; and he swaggers upon the Occasion (according to his usual Vanity) as having by
this Demonstration determined a Question of the
greatest Moment. Then he goes on thus; as the
Fluent of x/x +a depends upon the Measure of a
Ratio, and the Fluent of x/x x+aa upon theMeasure
of an Angle; so he had more than once expressed
his Wishes, that the Progression may be continued,
and it be determined to what Problem the Fluents of
x/x4 + a4, x/x8 + a8, &amp;c. may be referred. His Desire is answered in my general Solution, which
contains an infinite Number of such Progressions.
I can go yet farther, and shew him how by Measures of Ratio's and Angles, without any Exception
or Limitation, the Fluent of this general Quantity
dzz~n+~n 1/e +f zn +gz 2n or even this dzz~n+~n 1/e + fzn+gz2n+hz3n
may be had; where ~, as before, represents any Integer, and the Denominator ~ of the Fraction ~, represents any Number in this Series, 2. 4. 8. 16. 32. &amp;c.
any whole Number being denoted by its Numerator
~. In truth I am inclined to believe,that Mr. Leibnitz's grand Question ought to be determined
</page>
<page id="148">
the contrary Way; and that it will be found at last,
that the Fluent of any rational Fluxion whatever,
does depend upon the Measures of Ratio's and
Angles, excepting those which may be had in finite
Terms even without introducing Measures.
Dr. Taylor knowing by this Letter what the Author had done, was pleased to propose the Invention
of the Fluents of the two last Fluxions as a Problem
to the Mathematicians in foreign Parts. Mr. Bernoulli in the Leipsic Acts of 1719. p. 256, did shew
accordingly how they are reducible to Conic
Area's. The Editor has published the Author's own
Solution by Measures of Ratio's and Angles; and upon
this Foundation has constructed new Tables of Logometrical and Trigonometrical Theorems,for the Fluents
of Fluxions reduced to 94 Forms, part rational and part
irrational. He has likewise added general Notes upon
the chief Difficulties in the Book, together with a Method of composing Synthetical Demonstrations of Logometrical and Trigonometrical Constructions, illustrated by various Examples.
The first Treatise in the Miscellaneous Works is
concerning the Estimation of Errors in Mixt Mathematicks. It consists of 28 Theorems, to determine the
Proportions among the least contemporary Variations
of the Sides and Angles of Plane and Sphaerical Triangles, while any two of them remain invariable. An
Example will shew their great Use in Astronomy. The
Time of the Day or Night is frequently to be determined by the Altitude of some Star. Let it then be
proposed to find the Error, that may arise in the Time,
from any given Error in taking the Altitude. By applying the 22d Theorem to the Triangle form'd by the
Complements of the Star's Altitude and Declination
</page>
<page id="149">
and by the Complement of the Pole's Elevation, the
Author shews, that the Variation of the Angle at the
Pole, and consequently the Error in Time, will be as
the Error in the Altitude directly, as the Sine Complement of the Pole's Elevation inversely, and as the
Sine of the Star's Azimuth from the Meridian inversely. Consequently, if the Error in the Altitude
be given, under a given Elevation of the Pole, the Error in Time will be reciprocally as the Sine of the
Azimuth contained by the Meridian and the Vertical
which the Star is in. This Error therefore will be the
same, whatever be the Altitude of the Star in the same
Vertical; and will be least when the Vertical is at
right Angles to the Meridian. But will be absolutely
the least in the same Circumstance, if the Observer be
under the AEquator. In which Case, if the Error in
the Altitude be one Minute, the Error in the Time will
be four Seconds, If the Observer recedes from the
AEquator towards either Pole, the Error will be increased in the Proportion of the Radius to the Sine
Complement of the Latitude: So that in the Latitude
of 45 Degrees it will be 52/3 Seconds,and in the Latitudes
of 50 and 55 it will be 62/9 and 63/37/8 Seconds respectively.
If the Star be in any other vertical Oblique to the Meridian, the Error will still be increased in the Proportion of the Radius to the Sine of that oblique Angle.
Lastly, if the Error in the Altitude be either bigger or
less than one Minute, the Error in Time will be bigger or less in the same Proportion. Much after the
same manner may the Limits of Errors be computed in
otherCases,which arise from the Inaccuracy of Observations, and from hence the most convenient Opportunities for observing are also determined.
The Second Treatise is concerning the Differential
Method. The Author having wrote it, before he had
</page>
<page id="150">
seen Sir Isaac Newton's Treatise upon that Subject,
has handled it after a manner somewhat different.
The Title of the Third Treatise is Canonotechnia
or concerning the Construction of Tables by Differences. It consists of ten Propositions, most admirably contrived for expeditious Computation of intermediate Terms in any given Series. The last Proposition, which contains a general Solution of the whole
Design, is this; Datis seriei cujuscunque terminis aliquot aequidistantibus, quorum intervalla secanda
sunt in aequales quotlibetcunq; partes, propositum sit
invenire terminos inter serendos.
The Book concludes with three small Tracts, concerning the Descent of Bodies, the Motion of Pendulums in the Cycloid, and the Motion of Projectiles,
composed in a very natural and easy manner.
The Author has wrote some other Pieces, yet unpublish'd, which the Editor has given an Account of
in his Preface to the Book.
The Reader will find every Subject treated with uncommon Elegance and Simplicity.
