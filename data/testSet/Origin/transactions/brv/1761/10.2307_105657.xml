LXXIX. An Account of a Work, intituled,
Jacobi Christiani Schaeffer icones et descriptio Fungorum quorundam singularium et memorabilium; simul Fungorum
Bavariae icones nativis coloribus expressae
editioni, jam paratae, propediem evulgandae, denunciantur; by Mr. William
Hudson, F. R. S.
THIS treatise consists of sixteen
pages, and is divided into two
parts; the first contains the figures and descriptions of
some singular and remarkable Fungi; the second contains proposals for publishing the figures of all the Fungi
growing in Bavaria, coloured after nature. The title
page farther sets forth, that the materials for this work
are already provided, and that it is carried on under
the direction, and at the expence, of the Electoral
Academy at Munich in Bavaria.
Read March 25,
1762.
The author begins, by saying, that as it fell to his
lot, to inform the public, that the edition of this
most useful work, which was promised last year, was
actually begun; but he could not prevail on himself
to conform to the plain method commonly used on
these occasions; thinking it would be more acceptable
to the public, if he prefixed something of a new and
singular nature to the proposals; to which purpose,
nothing could be better adapted, as it seemed to him,
than coloured figures, and descriptions of some remarkable Fungi, which had lately fallen in his way.
</page>
<page id="496">
These were selected from a number of others, and,
according to him, serve to illustrate and confirm an
hypothesis he had adopted, and by which the existence of seeds, and consequently the propagation of
the Fungi, are rendered doubtful.
The Fungi, which he has given figures of, and
which he uses to confirm his opinion, are certainly
very irregular, and perhaps not easy to be accounted
for. In the three first of them, more than one Fungus grows from one common base, or stem; and
what seems extraordinary to the author is, that part
of the base of one of the Fungi does not touch the
ground, but rests on the pileus, or cap of the other,
and consequently cannot receive from the ground
what is necessary for its rise, evolution, and nourishment. I must own, I do not see the force of this
argument; for why may not one common stem, the
bottom of which is fixed in the ground, give nourishment to each of the Fungi, though part of the stem
of one rests upon the pileus of the other? Does not
common experience prove, that nourishment can be
conveyed through imperfect branches, even when
such parts as would be judged, at first sight, to be
necessary to convey the nutritive pieces are wanting?
This is the case of trees, when all the bark is stript
off quite round a branch, and yet that branch shall
bear flowers and fruit, in great quantity.
The fourth figure exhibits two Fungi, out of the
pileus of which grows another complete Fungus,
with stem, pileus, and lamellae, of the same kind
with the lower one, in every respect. However extraordinary this may be, yet it seems by no means to
prove
</page>
<page id="497">
prove his hypothesis, or even suggest any reason for a
new one, about the propagation of the Fungi; for
why may not the cap of the Fungus afford as proper
a bed for a seed, that happens to be lodged there, as
the earth itself? We know that a birch tree has often
been found growing out of the head of an oak, yet no
one suspects from thence, that the birch is propagated
without seed. Our author, indeed, seems to be sensible himself of the insufficiency of his arguments, hitherto made use of, to prove his new hypothesis, and
suspects, he says, had he nothing more to produce in
its favour, people might be apt to make objections;
but luckily he has two other Fungi, that will serve his
purpose better, which are represented by figure the
fifth and last. In these the edges of the pileus of one
Fungus adheres only to the upper surface of the pileus
of another, and receives thence all its nourishment.
Now, though it may be difficult to account for this
strange position, yet, I think, the consequence our
author draws from it does not follow, viz. that Fungi
differ from other plants, as to propagation, and in
some other respects. As to propagation, the same
answer will serve, that was made use of above; and
what farther particulars, in this instance, deserve notice, will be considered, when I come to my observations on the corollaries he draws from all the Fungi
represented in his book.
The corollaries are as follow:
Corol. 1st, That the mode of rise, evolution, increment, and propagation, of Fungi, must be of a
peculiar kind, and totally different from that which
prevails in other kinds of plants.
</page>
<page id="498">
Corol. 2d, That what from the analogy of the
other plants is called the seed, of the Fungi cannot
properly be called seed.
Corol. 3d, That there must be such a similarity
in all the parts of the Fungi, that it is indifferent
whether any part be placed above or below, whether
it communicates or receives nourishment.
Lastly, That every Fungus, according to his hypothesis, is contained in an entire and perfect state from
the beginning, in every egg, or, as it is called, its
seed, and wants nothing but evolution, to imbibe the
necessary juices.
These are the corollaries our author draws; and,
for a farther confirmation of his doctrine, refers to a
treatise expresly written on this subject, in which, he
says, he has made use of such strong arguments, that
it would be quite needless to add any thing more in
this place. Had I an opportunity of perusing this
treatise, it is possible I might find reason to agree
with him; but his arguments must be quite of another nature, than what appears here, to make me
think these plants exempt from the common laws of
vegetables.
For, as to the supposed difference in regard to rise,
evolution, increment, and propagation, which is his
first corollary, it has been considered already in part,
and will be more fully considered, when I come to
his third corollary.
As to the second, viz. That what, from analogy,
is called the seed, of the Fungi cannot properly be
called seed. I must own, I cannot see the least foundation for any distinction between the seeds and eggs
of plants, the latter of which terms, he thinks, ought
</page>
<page id="499">
to be used, when we speak of the Fungi: for those
terms are perfectly analogous, by the confession of all
the nicest observers of nature; and what is called the
egg in animals, goes under the name of seed in vegetables. Thus Linnaeus says, Philosophia Botanica,
p. 88. every living thing comes from an egg; consequently, all vegetables, whose seeds appear to be
eggs from their final cause, which is to produce an
offspring. He then cites a passage from our Harvey,
to the same purpose. Our author seems to have been
led into this confusion of ideas, by the improper use
of the word semen, or seed, which is applied to the
impregnating juice in animals, and to the parts which
contain the embryo in vegetables, which are by no
means analogous: for the impregnating dust in vegetables, answers to the impregnating juice in animals,
as it has a similar use; and the eggs in animals answer to what we call seeds in plants.
When our author asserts, in the third corollary,
that there must be such a similarity in all the parts of
the Fungi, that it is indifferent whether any part be
placed above or below, whether it communicates or
receives nourishment, I suppose he draws this corollary from the fifth and sixth Fungus; for in those, the
upper Fungus adheres only to the edge of the cap, or
pileus, of the upper surface of the cap of the lower
Fungus. The answer to this case, which was before
omitted, shall now be made; nor is it at all difficult,
for it appears, by Dr. Hales's vegetable Statics, experiment the 41, fig. 24. that a tree inarched between two other trees, though its root be cut off, or
dug out of the ground, will continue to grow; and
that many trees will grow in an inverted state. In
</page>
<page id="500">
what respect, then, do Fungi differ from all other
plants, as to the similarity in all the parts, &amp;c.?
Lastly, when our author asserts, That every Fungus
is contained in an entire and perfect state from the beginning, in the egg, or, as it is called, the seed, and
wants nothing but evolution, in order to imbibe the
necessary juices; when our author asserts this, he asserts nothing but what will be readily granted by every
one, who has read the observations made by modern
philosophers, on this part of nature, and the only
difference between him and others is, that he confines himself to one order of plants, what they imagine, from good reason, to be the case of all; and
this seems likewise to be the case throughout the animal creation, with this difference only, that, in some
animals, some parts fall off entirely, after a certain
time, and a new form ensues; yet even here, all the
forms preceding the last may, and perhaps ought, as
has been observed by Linnaeus, to be looked upon as
embryo states.
Upon the whole, I think our author seems inclined
to invent a new hypothesis, from a few insufficient
data, rather than to be forced into it by any leading
phaenomena, which ought to be very strong and convincing, to make us give up an analogy, that is confined within such moderate bounds. However, this
ought not to prejudice us in relation to the latter part
of this work; on the contrary, it ought to give us a
favourable opinion of him, as it shews his zeal and
application to this part of natural history. A man
may be an excellent and useful observer, and yet be a
very indifferent natural philosopher.
</page>
<page id="501">
I come now to the second part, which contains the
proposals, and with the greater pleasure, as, at the
same time that it affords no opportunity for criticism, it
gives us hopes of seeing a very useful work, on one of
the most obscure parts of botany.
The author observes, that the Electoral Academy
at Munich, from its first institution, determined to
turn their thoughts particularly to this part of natural
history, which, hitherto, has been but indifferently
cultivated; and, in consequence of this determination,
the present method proposed to them was approved of.
He adds, that the year before last, viz. 1760, though
the drought was very great, they not only had an accession of above an hundred Fungi, but that plates of
them were entirely finished, both as to engraving and
colouring, and fit to be published. The circumstances
and method of proceeding in this work, are as follow,
and will, as the author assures the public, be strictly
and religiously observed.
~ 1. They will begin by publishing the different
species of Fungi, engraved and coloured according to
the specimen in these proposals; with which the public will have reason to be satisfied. While these are
publishing, they will be looking out after other Fungi,
that may grow in Bavaria.
~ 2. These plates, when completed, will make a
separate volume, intituled, Jacobi Christiani Schaeffer
Fungorum Bavariae, potissimum qui circa Ratisbonam
nascuntur, icones, auspiciis et impensis Academiae Electoralis Bavariae Monacensis accurate delineatae, et publici
juris factae. This volume may be useful, without the
other volumes, of which hereafter.
</page>
<page id="502">
~ 3. There will be no plates of the Fungi, but
such as have been examined from the first growth,
and, if possible, from the egg, or seed, as it is called.
~ 4. There will be at least the following primary
figures of every kind of Fungi; viz. The Fungus before it is unfolded. 2. When it is half perfect, or
half grown. 3. Its characteristic appearance. 4. its
dissection. Lastly, whenever it may be necessary, In
its decaying state.
~ 5. Besides these primary figures, there will be
added as many secondary ones, as there are changes,
which may render a Fungus dubious; and the author
foresees, that sometimes one species may require two,
three, or four plates.
~ 6. The plates will be all engraved by able artists,
and well coloured.
~ 7. All the parts serving for propagation will be
represented, both according to their natural appearances, and also magnified.
~ 8. Whenever it may be necessary, figures representing particular parts dissected will be made use of,
both of the natural bigness, and as seen through the
glass.
~ 9. In all the names and division of the genera,
Linnaeus alone will be followed.
~ 10. To give a greater variety to the work, in its
progress, sometimes the species of one genus will be
published, sometimes of another; but yet in such a
manner, that order will not be totally neglected.
~ 11. No order will be observed, either in the
species or in the individuals. No specific names, or
synonyms, will be given; instead of which, they
will be numbered according to each genus, and a
</page>
<page id="503">
short explanation be put at the bottom of each plate,
as in those annexed to this treatise.
~ 12. To the end that beginners in botany, the
illiterate, and even the country people, may be able
to know the genera of the Fungi, as far as is necessary for them, the author hopes, that, before next
Easter, or certainly not long after, copper-plates, engraved and coloured, will be published, representing
all the genera, in such a manner, that they may be
easily known. These plates, along with descriptions,
will make another separate volume, which will be
intituled, Isagoge in Fungorum Bavariae historiam,
&amp;c.
~ 13. When all the Fungi of Bavaria are finished,
it is proposed to go on with such foreign ones as can
be procured.
~ 14. As soon as the collection of the Fungi of
Bavaria shall be completed, a new and last volume
will follow, containing accurate descriptions, explications, synonyms, of authors, and whatever else
may be thought necessary. This volume will be intituled, Fungorum Bavariae historia.
~ 15. No payment is expected beforehand; but yet
such as are willing to encourage this work, are desired
to send their names to Ildephonsus Kennedy, secretary
to the academy at Munich, or to the author, at Ratisbon, in letters post-paid, that the expences of this
work, sufficiently great of themselves, may not be increased.
~ 16. This kind of subscription is judged necessary;
because copies in Latin and German will be printed
separately, and no more of either sort, than the number of purchasers.
</page>
<page id="504">
~ 17. A certain number of plates will be published
every month, not fewer than six, nor more than
twelve.
~ 18. For each parcel of plates, a certain price
will be fixed, according to the number, each plate
at the rate of ten creutzers; so that six plates will sell
for a florin of the Rhine, according to the value it shall
go at, when the plates are published; which price,
though by no mean great, yet, it is to be hoped, that,
after the sale of some parcels, the rest may be sold
still cheaper.
N. B. The florin, here mentioned, is worth about
two shillings English; and therefore, each plate
will sell for about four pence.
There is no room for suspicion, that this work
will not be completed, as too often happens in this
way of publishing by parts: for, as far as human
foresight can go, every thing is so prepared and ordered, that there can be no reasonable doubt that the
work will be continued, and finished.
Lastly, As the intention of this work, says the author, is to facilitate the knowledge of the genera and
species of Fungi, as much as possible; that we may
be better instructed by persons skilful in this affair;
by what name they judge it is called by authors not
now living; by what name it is vulgarly known in
their own country; and what use is made of it amongst
their countrymen, and in what manner.
For these ends, says our author, the Electoral Academy enjoined me to apply to academies, literary societies, and men of learning, either skilful in natural
history, or promoters of it, in other countries, desiring,
that they will be pleased to communicate any obser4 vations</page>
<page id="505">
vations relating to these questions to the said academy;
which, as it will be highly acceptable to it, will be
gratefully acknowledged, whenever occasion offers.
Thus far the author, in relation to his proposals,
which, as far as can be judged by the plan and specimen, seem to deserve the encouragement of the curious.
Every one, who is conversant in botany, knows
how obscure and imperfect this part of it still remains,
after all that has been done upon the subject. Micheli
and Dillenius were the first botanists that examined
this order of plants, with any degree of accuracy; and
though their observations are very considerable, and
have been of great service to preceding botanists, yet
Linnaeus, who mentions them with applause, says,
Philosophia Botanica, p. 241. that the order of Fungi,
to the reproach of botany, still remains a chaos, as
we are ignorant what is a species, and what a variety.
Since the afore-mentioned authors, Gleditschius,
who wrote a tract on the same subject, which is commended, expresses himself also to the same purpose:
for, speaking of Dillenius, in the preface, p. 5. he
says, that his genera are not only not well determined,
but are even constructed in such a manner, as to contradict the natural characters; and as to Micheli, that
though he first determined the seeds of the Fungi, yet
his genera are too artificial; and therefore, he himself
follows the method of Linnaeus.
Gleditschius seems to have taken great pains about
this subject; but candidly owns, that, after all he
had been able to do, in order to distinguish species
from varieties, by collecting all the Fungi he could
find, disposing and describing them according to the
</page>
<page id="506">
degree of similitude, yet he found himself osten at a
loss, and unable absolutely to determine which side to
take.
The book of Gleditschius was published in the
year 1753, and is, I believe, the latest writer who
has done much on this subject, except, perhaps, Scopoli, in his Flora Carneolica, published anno 1760,
who differs from all the preceding botanists, in relation to species and varieties; and though his work has
great merit, both in relation to this and other orders
of plants, especially the Cryptogamiae, yet there still
remains much to be done, as, I believe, every skilful
reader will easily allow.
From all that has been observed, I would draw a
few conclusions in favour of the proposals in question.
First, then, The uncertainty of authors on this
branch of botany, shews, that it requires a still farther
examination, than has hitherto been made.
2dly, That though, in general, since the writings
of Linnaeus, figures have been, in a great measure,
laid aside, yet in this, and some other obscure parts of
botany, they may be employed to good purpose.
3dly, That the curious in botany ought to look on
themselves as particularly obliged to those, who are
inclined to labour and make researches in the obscure,
and, according to the vulgar opinion, contemptible
parts of nature, especially this order of plants, some
of which are used for the table, and not a few of them
are of a poisonous nature, so that a mistake may, and
has, perhaps, sometimes proved of fatal consequence.
