II. An Account of a Book, intitled, P. D. Pauli
Frisii Mediolanensis, &amp;c. Disquisitio mathematica in causam physicam figurae et
magnitudinis Telluris nostrae; printed at
Milan in 1752. inscribed to the Count de
Sylva, and consisting of Ten Sheets and a
half in Quarto: By Mr. J. Short, F. R. S.
IT may be laid down as a rule in
mix'd mathematics, `` That the determination of no physical quantity be carried farther than the observations, or other mechanical
measures, can bear;'' lest there follow this incongruity, of the conclusion being more extensive than
the premises. It were absurd, for instance, in the
resolution of a triangle, to compute an angle to the
exactness of seconds, or a side to centesms of an inch,
when, perhaps, the instruments used can measure no
angle less than 10 minutes, or a side but to the exactness of a foot The conclusions of arithmetic and
geometry are indeed rigorously true, but they are only
hypothetical; and whenever the quantities, that enter
any practical question, cannot be measured, but within certain limits, it were in vain to look for an answer perfectly accurate. The error of the instrument
becomes itself one of the data; and we must content ourselves to find the limits, which the quantity
sought cannot well exceed, or fall short of, by such
rules, as the great Mr. Cotes has left us in his excellent treatise on the subject.

2. In like manner, when any physical theory is
deduced from observations, its accuracy will still be
in proportion to that of the observations, on which it
is founded. Sir Isaac Newton, we find, in computing the ratio of the earth's axis to its equatorial
diameter, confines himself to a reasonable approximation, and to three places of figures (229 to 230);
because, whether that ratio is deduced from the different lengths of isochronous pendulums in different
latitudes, from the measurement of distant degrees
of a meridian, or from both; the elements of the
calculus can scarcely furnish a greater degree of exactness. And of the same judicious caution we have
many other examples in the works of that incomparable author.
3. On the other hand, when observations and
theories are brought together, and compared, nothing
can be justly inferred against a theory from its disagreement with the observations, unless that disagreement is greater, than can be fairly imputed to the imperfection of instruments, and to the unavoidable
mistakes of an observer; especially, if the difference
should be sometimes in excess, and at other times in
defect; or, according to some of the observations,
should intirely vanish.
4. Altho' these rules, manifestly well-founded,
have been followed by all the best writers, our author observes, that several ingenious men, both in
France, and in Italy, have deviated from them; particularly in treating of the famous question concerning the figure of the earth. Some, with Messieurs
Clairaut and Bouguer, attributing too much to the
observations, that have been made, and taking them
</page>
<page id="7">
for absolutely exact, have concluded Sir Isaac Newton's reasonings on that subject to be faulty; while
Father Boscowic, a Jesuit at Rome, making them
quite loose and uncertain, thinks no argument at all
can be drawn from them, concerning the earth's
figure; far less in confirmation of the Newtonian
theory.
5. In opposition to these two extremes, equally contrary to reason, as they are to each other, F. Frisi writes
the treatise now before us; in the introduction to which
he shews, 1. That, altho' the ratio of the axis of the
earth to its equatorial diameter is, from M. de Maupertuis's operations in Lapland, and afterwards in
France, that of 177 to 178; and by the theory only
229 to 230; yet the difference is no more, than what
might arise from a mistake of about 60 toises in the
measure of either of the two degrees, that are compared, or of 30 toises in each of them. Or, suppose
the measure of the arcs to be exact, the same difference might be owing to an error of 4 or 5 seconds in the astronomical part. And such errors,
or others equivalent to them, in a course of so many combined operations, our author looks upon as
difficult to be avoided. But he adds, if the observations of M. de Maupertuis, and his fellow academicians, seem to differ from the theory, those of
Messieurs Bouguer and de la Condamine exactly
agree with it: According to whom, a degree at the
equator, containing 56753 toises, and in latitude
49~ 22~ 57183 toises, the difference of the axis and
equatorial diameter comes out to be 1/229.
6. In answer to F. Boscowic, and those who make
no account of the observations, our author allows,
</page>
<page id="8">
that, if they were such, as M. Cassini, and some other
academicians, made in France, of the measure of a
parallel of latitude, they could not be much depended
on; that method being liable to several obvious inconveniencies. But he insists, that, with the excellent instruments, which were used, and, considering the distinguished skill of the observers, as well at the polar
circle as in France, and at the equator, the error upon
one degree of the meridian could not exceed 60 or
70 toises; which is a degree of exactness not only
sufficient for the determination of the first question,
viz. whether the spheroid of the earth is flat or
long; but likewise to found an agreement between
the observations and the theory, as near as can be expected or desired.
7. The work itself is divided into ten chapters:
I. De observationibus circa telluris figuram hactenus
institutis.
II. De principiis et hypothesibus quibusdam.
III. De rotatione corporum, et vi centrifuga.
IV. De mutationibus ex motu circulari ortis.
V. De attractione corporum rotundorum.
VI. De comparatione gravitatis in variis homogeneae
sphaeroidis locis.
VII. De figura terrae.
VIII. De gradibus meridiani et parallelorum.
IX. De loxodromiis nautarum, de parallaxi lunae,
et aliis ex eadem theoria pendentibus.
X. De theoriae et observationum consensu.
8. In chap. 1. we have a short history of the inquiries, that have been made into the magnitude and
figure
</page>
<page id="9">
figure of the earth down to the present times; and
the preference is justly given to the measurements of
Mr. Norwood in England, A. D. 1635, and of the
members of the French Academy of Sciences since
that time. From these he gathers, that, within less
than 60 or 70 toises, the lengths of a degree of the
meridian are as follows:
8~ Toises.
Lat. 00 56753
45 0 57100
49 22 57183
53 0 57300
66 20 57400
9. Chap. II. contains an account of the principles,
on which this theory is founded; viz. the universal
gravitation of matter, and the diurnal rotation of the
earth. Our author mentions likewise the hypothesis
of the earth's being originally in a fluid state; but rejects it as precarious and improbable. He allows however, that, with regard to the present question, it is
all one whether it was first a fluid or not, seeing the
ocean is circumfused just in the same manner, and
to the same altitude, as if the whole was still a fluid.
10. Chap. III. and IV. are employed in the doctrine of centrifugal forces, and their effect in changing
a fluid sphere into the form of an oblate spheroid.
In the former of these chapters, the author resolves,
as usual, the centrifugal force of a particle into two
others; one, that acts directly contrary to the gravitation of the particle; and the other a force in a direction perpendicular to it. And this last he considers
</page>
<page id="10">
again as acting laterally upon the contiguous particles
impelling them towards the equator. But the quantity of this force, when greatest at the octant, he
computes to be only 1/6 68168 of the force of gravity;
and therefore, says he, it may be safely neglected.
The truth is, after the spheroid is come to be in a
permanent state, and all its parts in aequilibrio, there
is no longer any such lateral force at all; it being
now intirely satisfied by the gradual contraction of
the earth's axis.
11. The general contents of the following chapters are sufficiently expressed in their titles already
given. Nor can we be more particular, without
entering into a detail of algebraical operations, which
would be improper for this place; and which is the
less necessary, as the same things have been treated
of by several other authors.
This does not, however, in the least detract from
the merit of F. Frisi; who discovers throughout
this work much acuteness and skill, joined with all
the candor and ingenuity, that become a philosopher.
And as he has not yet exceeded his 23d year, it may
be expected, that the sciences will one day be greatly
indebted to him; especially as we find him actually
engaged in composing a complete body of physicomathematical learning.
12. There is only, in his VI. Chapter, a criticism
upon one of Sir Isaac Newton's demonstrations, in
which we cannot agree with this ingenious author.
And as this demonstration has proved a stumblingblock, not only to F. Frisi, but to many other learned
men, we shall be obliged to consider that part of it,
which has been mistaken, at some length, by the
help of the following scheme:
</page>
<page id="11">
A
a
PQ
pCq
b
B
In which let the ellipsis ApBqA, whose axes AB,
pq, are in any given ratio, as of m to n, have the circles apbq, and APBQ, inscribed and circumscribed
to it: And if the figure revolves on the axis PQ,
there will be generated an oblate spheroid ApBqA,
with two spheres, the greater circumscribed to the
spheroid, and touching it in its equator AP A, and
the lesser inscribed and touching it in the poles pq;
the solid content of the spheroid being the first of
the two mean proportionals between the solidity of
the exterior sphere, and that of the interior.
But if the figure revolves on the axis AB, there
will be generated a prolate spheroid ApBqA, inscribed
in the exterior sphere at the poles AB; and circum~
scribing the interior sphere at the equator pqp, its solidity being the second of the above mean proportionB 2 als.</page>
<page id="12">
als. So that if O and P stand for the solidities of
the oblate and prolate spheroids, and S, s, for the
two spheres; S: O: P: s~ are in the continued
proportion of m: n. And S: P, or O: s:: m2: n2.
As S: s:: m3: n3.
Or we may with Sir Isaac Newton conceive of the
genesis of these solids as follows. 1. Let the sphere
APBQ be uniformly compressed in the direction of
its axis PQ, till that axis is diminished to pq, and
the sphere changed into the oblate spheroid. 2. Let
this spheroid be equally compressed in the direction
of that diameter of its equator, which is perpendicular to pq and AB, or to the plane of the figure; and
it will degenerate into the prolate spheroid, whose
poles are A and B. 3. Let this last be compressed in
the direction of its axis AB, till it is changed into
the sphere apbq and, in each of these compressions,
the solid space, which the body contains will be diminished in the ratio of m to n.
Now, as the determination of the earth's figure depends not only upon that of the ratio of the centrifugal force, by which a body tends to recede from
the axis of rotation to the power of gravity; but
likewise, upon the decrement of gravitation arising
from the body's being in that rotation actually removed to a greater distance from the centre: it is
not enough, that we know, from the experiments
with pendulums, the centrifugal force at the equator
to be about 1/280 of the force of gravity. We need,
farther, two distinct propositions; one to determine
the attractive force of a spheroid at its pole; and the
other to determine its attraction at the equator.
The first of these we have in Princip. lib. 1. prop.
</page>
<page id="13">
91. and the second has been supplied by several
authors. But Sir Isaac, who seldom does any thing
in vain, found, that he could, by one of his artifices,
make that 9 1st proposition serve likewise to determine
the attraction at the equator, by the following argument:
Let G be the attraction of the exterior sphere at A;
and let the decrement of the attraction, when the
sphere is diminished into the oblate spheroid ApBq,
be d; and ~ the decrement of this last attraction,
when the oblate spheroid is.diminished into the prolate, whose poles are AB: then, I say, d is nearly
equal to ~; the difference of the axes of the generating ellipse being small.
For the attractive matter, that is taken away, has,
in both cases, the same ratio to the matter, that is
left; and its position, with respect to that which is
left, is, in both cases, nearly the same: And therefore the successive attractions will be nearly in continued proportion, G: G d:: Gd+~ ~. Or
multiplying and rejecting d2 as inconsiderable, Gd=
G~, and d=~.
Thus, if the attractions of the sphere APBQ, and
of the prolate spheroid, at its pole A, be 126 and
125 respectively; the attraction of the intermediate
oblate spheroid at its equator will be 1251/2: and how
nearly this approaches to the truth, may be seen from
an exact computation of those attractions. For, if the
axes of the generating ellipse be 101 and 100, and the
attractive force at the surface of the sphere 126; the
attraction at the pole of the prolate spheroid will be
124.9838; and that at the equator of the oblate
125.5077; which exceeds the arithmetical mean
</page>
<page id="14">
between the two former, only by.0068; that is, by
about 1/18410th part of the attraction of the oblate
spheroid at the equator.
This reasoning is more shortly expressed (Princip.
lib. iii. Prop. 19.) as follows:
In which the expression `` eadem ratione'' occurring
a second time has misled F. Frisi and others, to think
this last ratio to be likewise that of the axes, or of
101 to 100: Whereas the identity of ratio's here asserted is to be referred only to the words `` utroque
casu;'' the ratio itself being not that of the axes, or
of m to n; but the half of that ratio (whatever it is
found to be by Prop. 91. lib. i.) which the attraction
of the sphere has to the polar attraction of the inscribed spheroid.
This inadvertence, however, of his own F. Frisi
charges upon Sir Isaac Newton; and files it up, as
the sixth of the errors, which he says have been
discovered in the Principia.... `` Ita dum stabilitae
in 19 lib. iii. propositione terrestrium axium proportionis</page>
<page id="15">
portionis fulcimentum et patrocinium quaerimus,
aliud in propositione eadem sophisma sese offert,
quod eorum, quae in principiis mathematicis Newtoni nacta (i. e. detecta) sunt hactenus, sextum
est, &amp;c.'' But we may take it off the file again;
and, for the present, leave the other five, till they are
considered of at more leisure.
13. In his 10th and last chapter, our author sums
up the evidence, and finds, that all the good observations, that have been made, as well by pendulums, as
by actual mensuration, concur with the theory, in
making the ratio of the earth's axis and equatorial
diameter to be as 229 to 230. This is indeed a sufficient confirmation of the theory of gravitation: But
it must be observed, that the coincidence is not perhaps quite so perfect as F. Frisi imagines. That
ratio corresponds well enough to the exactness, to
which the first elements of the calculus can be obtained; the length of a second pendulum, and that of
the earth's equatorial diameter, from which the centrifugal force (1/289) is deduced. But, if we suppose
that force to be accurately 1/289, and compute more
rigorously, we shall find the ratio in question to be
very nearly that of 225 to 226; agreeing still with
the observations as well as can be desired; and shewing, at the same time, the inimitable art of Sir Isaac
Newton in the contrivance and use of approximations; seeing the strictest calculation raises the equator not the third part of a mean geographical mile
above what he had found by his method.
I sent F. Frisi's book to my ingenious and learned
friend the reverend Mr. Murdock, Fellow of this
Society, who has fully consider'd the question concerning</page>
<page id="16">
cerning the figure of the earth; and who, after having perused the book, and discover'd the above mistake of F. Frisi, sent me the above theorem, and its
demonstration. He likewise sent me the following
theorems, which, he says, he had communicated to
M. de Bremond, in the year 1740, when he was
translating his treatise on sailing: But M. de Bremond
dying soon after, those, who had the care of publishing the translation, printed it incorrect in several
places; particularly the theorems for the prolate spheroid: On which account, he says, if they are thought
worth preserving, they may be inserted in the Philophical Transactions.
Postscript.
Theorems for computing the ratio of the attractive
force of a spheroid, at its pole or equator, to that
of the inscribed or circumscribed sphere.
1. In an oblate spheroid, the ratio is,
Pole 1+ 1/m2-1 m2/m2-1~3/2 X A: 1/3
Equator m2/m2-1~3/2 XA 1/m2-1: 2/3
2. In a prolate spheroid, the ratio is,
Pole 1 m2/m2-1 + m/m2-1~3/2 X l: 1/3
Equator m2/m2-1 m/m2-1~3/~ X l: ~/3
</page>

In which m: 1, as the greater axis of the generating
ellipse is to the lesser. A is a circular arc, to the
radius 1, whose tangent is ~m2-1, or its reciprocal,
if m2-1 ~ 1. And l is the natural logarithm of
S/V, S being the sine of the arc, whose co-sine is 1/m
x ~m2-1, and V the versed sine of the same arc.
Note, The two first theorems, by substituting t
for ~m2-1, coincide with those of Mr. Maclaurin
