<page>An Estimate of the Degrees of the Mortality
of Mankind, drawn from curious Tables
of the Births and Funerals at the City of
Breslaw; with an Attempt to ascertain the
Price of Annuities upon Lives. By Mr. E.
Halley, R.S.S.
THE Contemplation of the Mortality of Mankind,
has besides the Moral, its Physical and Political
Uses, both which have been some years since most judiciously considered by the curious Sir William Petty, in
his Natural and Political Observations on the Bills of
Mortality of London, owned by Captain John Graunt.
And since in a like Treatise on the Bills of Mortality of
</page>
<page id="597">
Dublin. But the Deduction from those Bills of Mortality seemed even to their Authors to be defective:
First, In that the Number of the People was wanting.
Secondly, That the Ages of the People dying was not
to be had. And Lastly, That both London and Dublin
by reason of the great and casual Accession of Strangers
who die therein,(as appeared in both, by the great Excess
of the Funerals above the Births) rendred them incapable
of being Standards for this purpose; which requires, if
it were possible, that the People we treat of should not
at all be changed, but die where they were born, without any Adventitious Increase from Abroad, or Decay
by Migration elsewhere.
This Defect seems in a great measure to be satisfied
by the late curious Tables of the Bills of Mortality at
the City of Breslaw, lately communicated to this Honourable Society by Mr. Justell, wherein both the Ages
and Sexes of all that die are monthly delivered, and
compared with the number of the Births, for Five
Years last past, viz. 1687, 88, 89, 90, 91, seeming to
be done with all the Exactness and Sincerity possible.
This City of Breslaw is the Capital City of the Province of Silesia; or, as the Germans call it, Schlesia,
and is scituated on the Western Bank of the River Oder,
anciently called Viadrus; near the Confines of Germany
and Poland, and very nigh the Latitude of London.
It is very far from the Sea, and as much a Mediterranean Place as can be desired, whence the Confluence of
Strangers is but small, and the Manufacture of Linnen
employs chiefly the poor People of the place, as well
as of the Country round about; whence comes that
sort of Linnen we usually call your Sclesie Linnen; which
is the chief, if not the only Merchandize of the place.
For these Reasons the People of this City seem most proC 2 per</page>
<page id="598">
per for a Standard; and the rather, for that the Births
do, a small matter, exceed the Funerals. The only
thing wanting is the Number of the whole People,
which in some measure I have endeavoured to supply
by comparison of the Mortality of the People of all
Ages, which I shall from the said Bills trace out with
all the Acuracy possible.
It appears that in the Five Years mentioned, viz.
from 87 to 91 inclusive, there were born 6193 Persons, and buried 5869; that is, born per Annum
1238, and buried 1174; whence an Encrease of the
People may be argued of 64 per Annum, or of about
a 20th part, which may perhaps be ballanced by the
Levies for the Emperor's Service in his Wars. But this
being contingent, and the Births certain, I will suppose
the People of Breslaw to be encreased by 1238 Births
annually. Of these it appears by the same Tables,
that 348 do die yearly in the first Year of their Age, and
that but 890 do arrive at a full Years Age; and likewise, that 198 do die in the Five Years between I and
6 compleat, taken at a Medium; so that but 692 of the
Persons born do survive Six whole Years. From this
Age the Infants being arrived at some degree of Firmness, grow less and less Mortal; and it appears that of
the whole People of Breslaw there die yearly, as in the
following Table, wherein the upper Line shews the Age,
and the next under it the Number of Persons of that

And where no Figure is placed over, it is to be understood of those that die between the Ages of the preceding and consequent Column.
From this Table it is evident, that from the Age of
9 to about 25 there does not die above 6 per Annum of
each Age, which is much about one per Cent. of those
that are of those Ages: And whereas in the 14, 15, 16,
17 Years there appear to die much fewer, as 2 and 3 1/2,
yet that seems rather to be attributed to Chance, as
are the other Irregularities in the Series of Ages, which
would rectifie themselves, were the number of Years
much more considerable, as 20 instead of 5. And by
our own Experience in Christ-Church Hospital, I am
informed there die of the Young Lads, much about one
per Cent. per Annum, they being of the foresaid Ages.
From 25 to 50 there seem to die from 7 to 8 and 9
per Annum of each Age; and after that to 70,they growing more crasie, though the number be much diminished, yet the Mortality encreases, and there are found to
die 10 or 11 of each Age per Annum: From thence the
number of the Living being grown very small, they
</page>
<page id="600">
gradually decline till there be none left to die; as may
be seen at one View in the Table.
From these Considerations I have formed the adjoyned Table, whose Uses are manifold, and give a more just
Idea of the State and Condition of Mankind, than
any thing yet extant that I know of. It exhibits the
Number of People in the City of Breslaw of all Ages,
from the Birth to extream Old Age, and thereby shews
the Chances of Mortality at all Ages, and likewise
how to make a certain Estimate of the value of Annuities for Lives, which hitherto has been only done by
an imaginary Valuation: Also the Chances that there
are that a Person of any Age proposed does live to any
other Age given; with many more, as I shall hereafter
shew. This Table does shew the number of Persons that
are living in the Age current annexed thereto, as follows:
Age. PerAge. PerAge. PerAge. PerAge. PerAge. PetAge. Persons.

49 357 56 282 63 212 70 142 77 68 84 20 Sum Total.
Thus it appears, that the whole People of Breslaw
does consist of 34000 Souls, being the Sum Total of the
Persons of all Ages in the Table: The first use hereof
</page>
<page id="601">
is to shew the Proportion of Men able to bear Arms in
any Multitude, which are those between 18 and 56, rather than 16 and 60; the one being generally too weak
to bear the Fatigues of War and the Weight of Arms,
and the other too crasie and infirm from Age, notwithstanding particular Instances to the contrary. Under 18
from the Table, are found in this City 11997 Persons,
and 3950 above 56,which together make 15947.So that
the Residue to 34000 being 18053 are Persons between
those Ages. At least one half thereof are Males, or
9027: So that the whole Force this City can raise of
Fencible Men, as the Scotch call them, is about 9000, or
9/34, or somewhat more than a quarter of the Number
of Souls, which may perhaps pass for a Rule for all
other places.
The Second Use of this Table is to shew the differing
degrees of Mortality,or rather Vitality in all Ages; for
if the number of Persons of any Age remaining after
one year, be divided by the difference between that
and the number of the Age proposed, it shews the odds
that there is, that a Person of that Age does not die in
a Year. As for Instance, a Person of 25 Years of Age
has the odds of 560 to 7 or 80 to 1, that he does not
die in a Year: Because that of 567, living of 25 years
of Age, there do die no more than 7 in a Year, leaving
560 of 26 Years old.
So likewise for the odds, that any Person does not
die before he attain any proposed Age: Take the number
of the remaining Persons of the Age proposed, and divide it by the difference between it and the number of
those of the Age of the Party proposed; and that shews
the odds there is between the Chances of the Party's
living or dying. As for Instance; What is the odds
that a Man of 40 lives 7 Years: Take the number of
Persons of 47 years, which in the Table is 377, and
</page>
<page id="602">
substract it from the number of Persons of 40 years,
which is 445, and the difference is 68: Which shews
that the Persons dying in that 7 years are 68, and
that it is 377 to 68 or 5 1/2 to 1, that a Man of 40 does
live 7 Years. And the like for any other number of
Years.
Use III. But if it be enquired at what number of
Years, it is an even Lay that a Person of any Age shall
die, this Table readily performs it: For if the number
of Persons living of the Age proposed be halfed, it will
be found by the Table at what Year the said number is
reduced to half by Mortality; and that is the Age, ~
which it is an even Wager, that a Person of the Age
proposed shall arrive before he die. As for Instance;
A Person of 30 Years of Age is proposed, the number
of that Age is 531, the half thereof is 265, which number I find to be between 57 and 58 Years; so that a Man
of 30 may reasonably expect to live between 27 and
28 Years.
Use IV. By what has been said, the Price of Insurance upon Lives ought to be regulated, and the difference is discovered between the price of ensuring the
Life of a Man of 20 and 50, for Example: it being
100 to 1 that a Man of 20 dies not in a year, and but
38 to 1 for a Man of 50 Years of Age.
Use V. On this depends the Valuation of Annuities
upon Lives; for it is plain that the Purchaser ought to
pay for only such a part of the value of the Annuity, as
he has Chances that he is living; and this ought to be
computed yearly, and the Sum of all those yearly Values being added together, will amount to the value of
the Annuity for the Life of the Person proposed. Now
the present value of Money payable after a term of years,
at any given rate of Interest, either may be had from
Tables already computed; or almost as compendiously,
</page>
<page id="603">
by the Table of Logarithms: For the Arithmetical
Complement of the Logarithm of Unity and its yearly
Interest (that is, of 1, 06 for Six per Cent. being
9, 974694.) being multiplied by the number of years
proposed, gives the present value of One Pound payable after the end of so many years. Then by the foregoing
Proposition, it will be as the number of Persons living
after that term of years, to the number dead; so are
the Odds that any one Person is Alive or Dead. And
by consequence, as the Sum of both or the number of
Persons living of the Age first proposed, to the number
remaining after so many years, (both given by the Table) so the present value of the yearly Sum payable after the term proposed, to the Sum which ought to be
paid for the Chance the person has to enjoy such an Annuity after so many Years. And this being repeated
for every year of the persons Life, the Sum of all the
present Values of those Chances is the true Value of
the Annuity. This will without doubt appear to be a
most laborious Calculation, but it being one of the principal Uses of this Speculation, and having found some
Compendia for the Work, I took the pains to compute the
following Table, being the short Result of a not ordinary number of Arithmetical Operations; It shews
the Value of Annuities for every Fifth Year of Age, to
the Seventieth, as follows.
Age. Years Purchase. Age. Years Purchase. Age. Years Purchase.
1 10,28 25 12,27 50 9,21
5 13,40 30 11,72 55 8,51
10 13,44 35 11,12 60 7,60
15 13,33 40 10,57 65 6,54
20 12,78 45 9,91 70 5,32
</page>
<page id="604">
This shews the great Advantage of putting Money
into the present Fund lately granted to their Majesties,
giving 14 per Cent. per Annum, or at the rate of 7 years
purchase for a Life; when young Lives, at the usual rate
of Interest, are worth above 13 years Purchase. It
shews likewise the Advantage of young Lives over those
in Years; a Life of Ten Years being almost worth 13 1/2
years purchase, whereas one of 36 is worth but 11.
Use V. Two Lives are likewise valuable by the same
Rule; for the number of Chances of each single Life,
found in the Table, being multiplied together, become
the Chances of the Two Lives. And after any certain
Term of Years, the Product of the two remaining Sums
is the Chances that both the Persons are living. The Product of the two Differences, being the numbers of the
Dead of both Ages, are the Chances that both the Persons are dead. And the two Products of the remaining
Sums of the one Age multiplied by those dead of the
other, shew the Chances that there are that each Party
survives the other: Whence is derived the Rule to estimate the value of the Remainder of one Life after another. Now as the Product of the Two Numbers in
the Table for the Two Ages proposed, is to the difference between that Product and the Product of the
two numbers of Persons deceased in any space of time,
so is the value of a Sum of Money to be paid after so
much time, to the value thereof under the Contingency
of Mortality. And as the aforesaid Product of the two
Numbers answering to the Ages proposed, to the Product of the Deceased of one Age multiplied by those
remaining alive of the other; So the Value of a Sum of
Money to be paid after any time proposed, to the value
of the Chances that the one Party has that he survives
the other whose number of Deceased you made use of,
in the second Term of the proportion. This perhaps
</page>
<page id="605">
may be better understood, by putting N for the number of the younger Age, and n for that of the Elder;
Y, y the deceased of both Ages respectively, and R, r
for the Remainders; and R+Y=N and r+y= n.
Then shall Nn be the whole number of Chances;
NnYy be the Chances that one of the two Persons
is living, Yy the Chances that they are both dead;
Ry the Chances that the elder Person is dead and the
younger living; and rY the Chances that the elder is
living and the younger dead. Thus two Persons of 18 and
35 are proposed, and after 8 years these Chances are required. The Numbers for 18 and 35 are 610 and 490,
and there are 50 of the First Age dead in 8 years, and
73 of the Elder Age. There are in all 610 ~ 490 or
298900 Chances; of these there are 50 ~ 73 or 3650
that they are both dead. And as 298900, to 298900
3650, or 295250: So is the present value of a Sum
of Money to be paid after 8 years, to the present value
of a Sum to be paid if either of the two live. And as
560 ~ 73, so are the Chances that the Elder is dead,
leaving the Younger; and as 417 ~ 50, so are the
Chances that the Younger is dead, leaving the Elder.
Wherefore as 610 ~ 490 to 560 ~ 73, so is the present
value of a Sum to be paid at eight years end, to the
Sum to be paid for the Chance of the Youngers Survivance; and as 610 ~ 490 to 417 ~ 50, so is the same
present value to the Sum to be paid for the Chance of
the Elders Survivance.
This possibly may be yet better explained by expounding these Products by Rectangular Parallelograms, as in Fig. 7. wherein AB or CD represents the
number of persons of the younger Age, and D E, BH
those remaining alive after a certain term of years;
whence CE will answer the number of those dead in
that time: So A C, BD may represent the number
</page>
<page id="610">
And so forth to the 60th year, when we suppose the elder
Life of Forty certainly to be expired; from whence till Seventy we must compute for the First and Second only, and
from thence to Ninety for the single youngest Life. Then the
Sum Total of all these Fourth Proportionals being taken out
of the value of a certain Annuity for 90 Years, being 16,58
years Purchase, shall leave the just value to be paid for an
Annuity during the whole term of the Lives of three Persons
of the Ages proposed. And note, that it will not be necessary to compute for every year singly, but that in most cases
every 4th or 5th year may suffice, interpoling for the intermediate years secundum artem.
It may be objected, that the different Salubrity of places
does hinder this Proposal from being universal; nor can it be
denied. But by the number that die, being 1174. per Annum
in 34000, it does appear that about a 30th part die yearly, as
Sir William Petty has computed for London; and the number
that die in Infancy,is a good Argument that the Air is but indifferently salubrious. So that by what I can learn, there cannot perhaps be one better place proposed for a Standard. At
least 'tis desired that in imitation hereof the Curious in other
Cities would attempt something of the same nature, than
which nothing perhaps can be more useful.
