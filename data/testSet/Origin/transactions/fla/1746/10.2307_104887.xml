CHEMISTRY being the most extensive Branch of Experimental
Philosophy, hath furnish'd Mankind with the greatest
Number of curious and useful Discoveries; for not
only the Art of separating Metals from their Ores, of
which Metals are form'd such Variety of useful Instruments, but likewise Cookery, which is so much
concern'd about the Food of Mankind during Health,
and also Pharmacy, which furnishes Medicines for
the restoring Health when lost, the Art of Dyeing,
and many other useful Manufactures, all owe their
Improvements to this Science; many of which have
been light on unexpectedly by the Operator, while

he had something else in View: but in many Cases
the Chemists complain, that, having once accidentally light on a curious Experiment, upon endeavouring to repeat it, they have never been able to
make their Process succeed exactly, as it did the
first time, notwithstanding that they made use of
the same Materials, in the same Quantity, and conducted the Process thro' exactly the same Operations.
Where then must the Cause of the Miscarriage lie?
Surely in the Degree of Heat made use of in the
two Experiments: For, in many common Operations, how usual is it for a Preparation to be spoiled
either by too little, or, most commonly, by too
much Fire, too long or too short a time applied!
In order therefore to prevent these many Miscarriages, I would advise the Chemist, in his Operations, to observe his Clock with as much Exactness as the Astronomer doth in his Observations;
and in order to know to a Certainty the very Degrees of Heat he ever made use of in any Process,
that so he may be able to repeat and continue the
same again in any Repetitions of the same Experiment,
let him have his Laboratory furnish'd with various
Sorts of Thermometers, proportion'd to the Degree
of Heat he intends to make use of. He will find
these Instruments as useful to him in his Processes,
as they have proved to the curious. Gardener in his
Stoves, who by them is taught to keep his Plants in
the same Degrees of Heat, as are natural to them in
their respective Climates; which hath been set forth
in Tables, after a very ingenious manner, by Mr.
Ssss2 Sheldrake</page>
<page id="674">
* Sheldrake of Norwich. And besides the enabling
him to perform his Operations with more Exactness,
these Instruments would save him a great deal of
Fuel; for as Liquors, while boiling, are not capable of receiving a greater Degree of Heat, all Fuel
which is used more than to keep them in that State
is useless; and the like happens in many other
Cases.
These Instruments would also be of great Service to
Maltsters, Brewers, Distillers, and Vinegar-makers; for,
by Thermometers placed in different Parts of the Heap
of wetted Malt, the proper Heat for its sprouting
might be determined, and then regulated: The same
for the Heat of the Kiln when the Malt is spread on
it. By Thermometers the Brewer may ascertain the
Heat of the Water when he pours it upon the Malt,
the Heat of the Wort when he sets it to work, and
the Heat while working: And in the like manner
the Distiller and Vinegar-maker, in a Word, every
Artificer, who employs Heat in his Business, may
by these Instruments be certain of every Degree necessary in each Part of his Work.
Many Experiments shew, that all known Bodies,
whether fluid or solid, increase their Bulk or raresy
by an Addition of Heat; and, on the contrary, contract or become more dense by the Diminution of
Heat, which is the Presence of Cold: And these
Alterations are always more or less sensible in proportion to the natural Rarity or Density of the
Bodies. The
* Now Truss-maker over against the End of Suffolk-street near
Charing-Cross, London, 1748.</page>
<page id="675">
The Air we live in, as it is the most rare
and light Fluid, so are its Alterations the most sensible; and indeed I know of no Experiments which
determine how far it is capable of being expanded
by Heat, or condensed by Cold; only we find that
it will make its Way thro' any Fluid in which it lay
dormant, when its elastic Property is rouzed by the
Approach of such an Heat as will make the Fluid boil.
On the other hand, when compress'd by a Fluid so
contracted by Cold, as to freeze, or become solid,
its Elasticity will only bear a certain Degree of Compression, till the Force wherewith it endeavours to
restore itself, exceeds the Force by which the Parts
of the Solid, that confines it, adhere to each other,
and so bursts its Prison; as we often see during hard
Frosts in Ice, and likewise Glass, and other hard Bodies, whose Parts cannot stretch.
Next to Air is Alcohol, or the highest rectified
Spirit of Wine: This, Water, and all other Liquids,
are capable of receiving no greater Degree of Heat
than what makes them boil, as was first demonstrated
by Monsieur Amontons, a Member of the Royal
Academy des Sciences at Paris; but that ingenious
Inventor of the Quicksilver Thermometer Mr. Fahrenheit hath discover'd, that when the Barometer
marks a greater Pressure of the Atmosphere, the
same Liquor will receive 8 or 9 Degrees more of
~ than when the Barometer is at the lowest.
From hence the great Professor Boerhaave gives the
Hint, that, from nice Experiments being made of
the different Degrees of Heat mark'd by a Thermometer in boiling Water compared with the different Heights of the Barometer, and Tables ~
</page>
<page id="676">
upon them, a Thermometer applied to boiling Water might, at Sea, where the Motion of the Ship
hinders Observations with the Barometer, serve to
determine the Difference of the Gravity of the Atmosphere. See his Chemistry, Tom. I. p. 171.
These, and all other Liquids, by a certain determinate Degree of Cold peculiar to each sort, lose their
Fluidity, and freeze, or become solid, but not in the
same Order as by Heat they boil; for by Cold Oil or
Water is sooner frozen than Spirit of Wine, tho' Spirit
of Wine will boil sooner than Oil or Water. All solid
Bodies likewise, as Minerals, Metals, and even Stones,
will become fluid, or melt, at a certain Degree of
Heat peculiar to each Species; and, when thoroughly
melted, it is probable they are capable of receiving
no higher Degree of Heat; and, on the Absence of
that Heat to a certain Degree, they all return to
their natural solid State. Hence we may reasonably
conclude, that Solidity is the natural State of all Bodies; and that some are only accidentally fluid, because their Constitution is such as to melt by those
Degrees of Heat which our Atmosphere is most commonly subject to. All solid Bodies are observed to
contract themselves into smaller Dimensions by Cold,
and gradually to expand themselves at the Approach
of Heat, till at last, being by Heat forc'd to the greatest
Degree of Expansion, the Particles of which they are
composed losing their Cohesion, they become fluid,
but no Experiments have yet been made, which determine whether Solids, exposed to Cold beyond
certain Degrees, will cease to contract any more.
The learned Dr. Muschenbroek, Prof. of Astronomy
at Utrecht, and F. R. S. hath lately invented a very
</page>
<page id="677">
ingenious Instrument, which he calls a Pyrometer
and which Dr. Desaguliers hath made some Improvements to *; a full Description of which he
hath given in his Course of Experimental Philosophy, Vol. I. p. 421. &amp;c. By this Instrument the
Elongation of Rods of several Sorts of Metals by the
Approach of a certain Number of Flames of a Spirit-Lamp, and likewise their as sudden Contraction,
on the extinguishing one or more of those Flames,
is render'd sensible to the Eye: Which sufficiently
evidences the Matter of Fact, and puts it beyond all
Doubt.
From the above-mention'd Property of Bodies
contracting and expanding in Cold and Heat, have
all Thermometers been constructed, that have ever
been made use of in order to observe and compare
the different Degrees of Heat, either in our Atmosphere, or in other Bodies. The most simple and
most sensible of any is that aereal Thermometer described by the great Mr. Boyle, in his New Experiments and Observations touching Cold, Lond. 1683.
410. p. 39. It consists of a glass Bubble, with a
very slender Stem not bigger than a Raven's Quill.
The Bubble is left full of Air, and a few Drops of
Water being convey'd into the Stem in an erect
Position, will there remain suspended to a certain
Height; but, by the least Addition of Heat, the Air
in the Bubble expanding will push the Water up
higher
* This Instrument hath since been greatly improved by that ingenious
Watch-maker Mr. John Ellicot, F. R. S. See Phil. Trans. No, 443.</page>
<page id="678">
higher; or, by the Approach of Cold, the Air contracting, the Water will fall lower in the Stem. This
Instrument may be of Use in small Degrees of Heat,
and in Cold, till the Water begins to freeze, when
it becomes useless.
The next in Order of Sensibility is that first invented by Cornelius Drebbelius of Alcmar, and
improved by Boerhaave. (See his Chemistry, Tom. I.
p. 152, &amp; 153.) It consists of an hollow glass Lens
joined to a Stem of a larger Size than in the preceding, and a Bason into which the End of the
Stem is inverted. The Air in the Lens must be so
much rarefied, that the Stem being inverted into a
tinged Liquor in the Bason, the Liquor will rise up
some way in the Stem; then, by the Application
of Heat to the Lens, the Liquor in the Stem will be
push'd down, and by Cold the Liquor will rise up.
This Instrument will give Notice of the smallest
Changes in the Air; but it cannot be immersed
into any Liquid for chemical Experiments, unless
the Stem were made much longer, and bent down
in Form of a Syphon: But even then it would be
very unhandy, and, like the preceding, it would
never serve for any Degree below what would
freeze the Liquor made use of, nor for any above
what would force out the confin'd Air through the
Liquor in the Bason. Besides, both these Instruments, being subject to the Pressure of the Atmosphere, are not proper, without comparing the Barometer at the same time, to determine the Degrees
of Heat at a great Distance of Time between each
Experiment.
</page>
<page id="679">
The most usual Sort of Thermometers is that described in the Account of the Experiments by the Academy of Cemento; which being the common ones,
made of Spirit of Wine ting'd, it is needless to describe.
The Bounds of the Degrees of Heat which these
will measure, and which is commonly called the
Range of the Instrument, are from the Degree
which freezes Spirit of Winc, up to that which
makes it boil. The Spirit-Thermometers, commonly
made here in London, are so graduated, that when
the Spirit is rarefied to the Degree that the most
sultry Sunshine commonly known in our Climate
of 51~1/2 N. Lat. can raise it, there is placed the
Mark 0. or Degree of no Cold. Some few are
mark'd 10 or 20 above this, if they are design'd to
be used in hotter Climates; but all are graduated
downwards from this: So that the 45~. is the Point
of temperate, and 65~. is the Point of freezing,
and 100~. is plac'd just above the Ball. But the
most accurate Spirit-Thermometers are those lately
made by the ingenious Mr. Reaumur, Member of
the Royal Academy of Sciences at Paris; he hath
taken a great deal of Pains, and used great Exactness,
in fixing the certain Points of freezing of Water,
of temperate Air, and boiling Water. He determines the freezing Point, by leaving his Thermometer a considerable time in Water, into which is
put a good deal of Ice, at a time when the Water
would not freeze of itself; and this he marks 0. or
the Degree of no Heat; and his Scale is mark'd
with Numbers running downwards from 0. measuring the Degrees of Cold, and upwards measuring
the Degrees of Heat: At 10 1/5 upwards he marks
</page>
<page id="680">
the Point of Temperate, which he determines by
placing his Instrument in a subterranean Cavern,
which is neither affected by Frost nor Sunshine, but
is observed to keep an equable Temperature all the
Year round; such as deep Cellars and Wine Valuts
commonly do. In boiling Water he finds that his
Thermometer rises to his 80th Division,* or 80 Degrees, which are formed by dividing the Spirit when
condensed to the freezing Point, into 1000 equal
Parts; so that, with the Heat which makes Water
boil, the Spirit is expanded only 80/1000, more than
with the Cold which freezes Water.
These Spirit-Thermometers are of Use in Experiments where somewhat greater Cold than the freezing of Water is required; but they can never be of
Use in any Degrees of Heat beyond the boiling of
the Spirit itself; because it then becomes volatile,
or rises up in Steam, and not only expands no more,
but likewise the Quantity is diminished by the Particles which fly up from the Surface of the Liquor,
and are suspended in the Top of the Tube.
Many have filled their Thermometers with various
Sorts of Oils ~: These indeed will measure many
Degrees above the boiling of Water, till they boil
themselves; and then they have the same Defect as the
Spirit
* But, with Submission to so great a Man, I cannot apprehend
that his Thermometers, when the Spirits are raised up to 80 do
mark any greater Degree of Heat than their own specific boiling
Heat, which, if they are Alcohol, or the most rectified Spirits, answer to 174. of Fahreuheit's Scale; if of the Strength of common
Brandy to 190. ~ See Dr. Martin's Essays Med. ~ Philos.
</page>
<page id="681">
Spirit ones just mention'd, which is the Liquor losing
of its Bulk by Evaporation; and they congeal much
sooner than Water, and so are useless in measuring
any Degrees of Cold.
The most useful Instruments, as they comprehend the largest Range, are the Mercurial Thermometers, which were brought into Use by that ingenious Artificer Fahrenheit, F. R. S. (See Phil.
Trans. No. 381.): But, to do Justice to a most worthy Member of the Royal Society, namely, Dr.
Halley, he first gave the Hint, and even proposed
the making Thermometers of Quicksilver long before Fahrenheit's Time (See Phil. Trans. No. 197.
p. 652.). However, Fahrenheit deserves Thanks
from the World for having brought these Instruments into Use, because they will measure the
greatest Degrees of Cold yet known; for no Cold
hitherto observed hath been able to freeze or render
Mercury solid: And in measuring Heat, they go far beyond boiling Water, even beyond the melting of Tin
or Lead. Fahrenheit begins his Scale from 0. the
Point to which the Mercury hath been observed to
fall by the greatest Cold in Ysland; and com
putes, that the Mercury then * occupies 11124 Parts.
This is his Point of no Heat. Then reckoning upwards from this, he finds that when the Mercury
is rarefied only 32 Parts or Degrees more, common
Water just begins to freeze: In a temperate Air it
will rise to about 60. The most sultry Sunshine
seldom raises it to 90; the Heat of an animal Body
to 96; the boiling of Alcohol to 174; the boiling
of
* See ~. Chem. Tom. I. p. 174.
</page>
<page id="682">
of Water to 212; and before the Mercury itself
boils, it will rise to 600.
I cannot here forbear giving an Abstract of a very
curious and surprising Experiment of Fahrenheit's,
concerning the artificial Production of Cold, as it is
related by Boerhaave in his Chemistry, Tom. I. p. 164.
Fahrenheit had a Mercurial Thermometer made with
so long a Stem, that he could carry down the Scale
76 Parts or Degrees below 0. With this Instrument he found, that Cold might be produced by
gradually pouring Spirit of Nitre upon powder'd
Ice, till the Mercury would subside to 40~ below 0.
that is 72~ * lower than the Cold which freezes common Water. Boerhaave, in his Chemistry, Tom. I.
p. 161. mentions a very pretty Way of determining
the freezing Point: He advises to hang the Thermometer free in the open Air, not against any Wall
or Building; and near it you must hang a Piece of
very fine Linen or Muslin just dipp'd in clean Water: When this begins to grow stiff, you will find
the Mercury stand at about the 33d Degree; and it
will also stand at the same Height when an hoar
Frost appears upon the Ground; which he looks
upon as a certain Sign of the Beginning of freezing.
Having thus given an Account of the several Sorts
of Thermometers hitherto used, and what Degrees of
Heat they are proper to measure, we find none of
them capable of measuring the greater Degrees
of Heat, which are the most commonly made use
of
* But what is this to the marvellous natural Cold of Siberia, 120~. below 0? See the Preface to? Flora Siberica. Petrop. 1747. ~.</page>
<page id="683">
of by the Chemists in many of their Operations. Besides, all the above Instruments, being made of
Glass, are easily broken by Accidents, and as liable
to crack of themselves, by being taken out of a
great Heat, and too suddenly exposed to Cold. I
therefore consider'd whether the above-mention'd
Property of Solids, and especially of Metals contracting with Cold, and expanding with Heat, might
not be applied to the Construction of an Instrument
capable of measuring all Degrees even of the greatest
Cold, as well as the greatest Heat, to the melting
Copper or Iron, which require more Heat than any
other Metals to melt them. Altho' the Alterations
in Metals are but small, in respect of those in Spirits, or even Mercury, yet it being found, that Iron,
e. g. becomes 1/60 longer * when red-hot, than when
of its natural Temperature; and Dr. Derham, in
his last Paper read before the Royal Society concerning the Vibration of Pendulums, says, that a Rod
39.126/1000 Inches long, becomes 1/10 Inch longer than its
natural Dimensions in temperate Air, by being exposed to Heat equal to that of an human Body;
2/100 Inch longer in hot Sunshine; that it was 2/10 or 1/5
Inch longer than its natural State, by being heated in
a flaming Heat; that it became 7/100 shorter than its
natural Length by being quenched in cold Water;
and still 3/100 shorter, by being put into a Mixture of
Salt and Snow. From which Experiments one may
conclude, that from Fahrenheit's Cold of 40 below
0. to the greatest Heat Iron can bear without melting, a Rod of three Feet long will have about 1/4 Inch
Increase; which Increase of Length will be Range
enough
* Vide Sturm. Coll.</page>
<page id="684">
enough to make all the intermediate Degrees observable upon an Instrument.
Suppose in Fig. 1. TAB. II. AB a Rod of Iron at its
natural Length by the Heat of the Atmosphere, placed
upright upon one End; upon the Point of that rests
a Bar CD moveable on an Axis at a; and that, by
making a Fire about the End B of the Rod, till it
is just ready to melt, the Rod will increase in Length
A b, and consequently push the Bar into the Situation c d. Now it is obvious to any one who understands ever so little of Mechanics, that tho' the Elongation of the Rod Ab be even scarce perceptible to
the Eye, yet if upon the Bar CD the Distance aA
from the Axis to the Place where the Rod BA pushes
against it be very small, and the other Part of the
Bar aD very long, the Arch Dd may be increased
at Pleasure, so as to bear to be divided into any
Number of Divisions that shall be found necessary:
For the Arch Dd will always be to the Arch Cc in
the same Proportion as the Distance Da is to aC;
and likewise the Chords of these Arches Dd and Ab
will be in the same Proportion; ~, ~, is the Situation
of the Lever on the Level; and if it be found inconvenient to make the Arm aD so long, as to make very
minute Alterations in the Length of the Rod AB
easily observable, this Inconveniency may be readily
removed by having a second Bar E F, turning on the
Axis g, whose Arm gE bearing up against the Extremity D of the first Bar or Lever, will rise with
it, or be press'd down by it; and the other Arm gF
being lengthen'd at Pleasure, the Arch Ff will be
as large as you find convenient; or even a third and
fourth Lever may be added.

When I first designed to have an Instrument constructed answering to the foregoing Principles of
Fig. 1. I drew a Figure of it, wherein I proposed
the Lever AD to have terminated in two Arches of
Circles made out of one Piece of Brass; the smaller
Arch formed on the Radius aA to be loaded with
a Quantity of Metal sufficient to overcome all the
Friction of the several Parts, so as to press down
with a considerable Weight, and always to rest upon
the Point A of the upright Rod A B; at a the Axis,
on which they were to turn; and the larger Arch
form'd on the Radius aD, was proposed to be a Sextant, the outward Edge of which was to be toothed,
which Teeth were to play into the Teeth of a small
brass Wheel carrying a steel Index like the Minutehand of a Clock, which small Wheel with the Hand
was to make one Revolution nearly by the utmost
Rise and Fall of the Sextant at D; or, instead of
Teeth, I proposed a Piece of a Watch-Chain to be
fasten'd to the upper Limb of the Sextant, and so to
be brought downwards, and passing nearly round
the small Wheel in one Groove, to be fasten'd to it:
In another Groove in this small Wheel was another
Piece of Watch-Chain to be fasten'd, which, being
passed contrarywise round the said Wheel, was to
have a Weight hung to it that would be a Counterpoise to the Sextant; but, upon consulting my two
ingenious Friends Mr. Geo. Graham and Mr. John
Ellicot two worthy Members of this Society, they
each of them persuaded me to lay aside that more
complexed Construction, and to have the Instrument
made in the plain and simple manner in which Mr.

<page id="686">
Jackson executed it for me in the Year 1736. as is
represented in Fig. 2 and 3. TAB. II.
The Description of the Instrument.
Fig. 2. ABa round Rod of Steel or Brass a Quarter of an Inch thick, and 3 Feet 1 Inch long:
When the Rod is of Brass 3 Feet long, the Point
A must be of Steel 1 Inch long, to prevent its
wearing away, or losing its Point; which conical
Point is made to screw on and off.
I had the first Rods made 1 1/2 Inch thick at B, and
of the same Thickness 6 Inches up; but I found
Inconveniences from that Form, and that a Rod all
of a Size was better.
CD, c d, are two iron Supporters, joined by a
flat cross Bar at Bottom Dd two Inches long, in the
middle of which is a Point 1/8 Inch high under B, which
goes into an Hole at the Bottom of the Rod B, and
serves to keep the Rod in its Place at Bottom, as the
cross Bar ** having an Hole in it, thro' ~which the
Rod passes, does in the middle or about 2/3 up the
Supporters, and the Point A goes into a small Hole
in the under Side of the Lever; all which keep the
upright Rod firm and steady in its Place. The iron
Supporters are flat, or parallel to the Front of the
Machine from C to X and c to x, where they are
twisted half-round, so that the lower Parts XD,
xd stand at right Angles with the upper Parts. This
Contrivance gives the freer Access to the Rod for the
Sand or Fluid into which the Machine is set to
measure the Heat of it, the Supporters standing 2
Inches asunder at Dd; and that the Degrees of Heat
</page>
<page id="687">
may be compared uniformly in different Experiments, the Bottom of the Rod must always be im
mersed to the same Height in the Matter to be examined; and therefore I make a Mark, a small Furrow ~ quite round the Rod, 1 1/2 Inch from the Bottom B. For the deeper the Rod is immersed into
any Matter, it will be lengthen'd the more by the
same Degree of Heat.
E F, the Lever, which turns upon an Axis G.
At F is fastened a String, which, passing twice round
the small Pulley H, has a Weight I hanging to the
other End of it, of about half a Pound, being enough
to keep the String always stretch'd. At the other
End E of the Lever is hung another Weight L,
which must be heavy enough not only to counterbalance the longer Arm G F, but press down upon the
Point A with a Weight sufficient to keep its steady.
MNO, is the back Part of the Plate, like the
Dial-Plate of a Clock made of Brass. See the Front
of it at Fig. 3.
The Pulley H turns upon an Axis C in Fig. 3.
which goes thro' the Plate, and on the other Side
or Front of the Dial-Plate carries a Hand or Index
AB in Fig. 3.
N. B. G being the Fulcrum of the Lever, the
Distance GA being very small, and the Distance
GF being very great, the smallest Motion at A
will produce a very great one at F, and therefore
the Index will turn very sensibly upon the Plate.
The Proportions of the Rod and Lever are discretionary; my Rods both of Steel and Brass are 3
Feet long in one solid Piece, but they have each a
Point or Cone of Steel 1 Inch high, that screws
</page>
<page id="688">
upon the Top at A. The Lever has 4 Inches from
E to A, 11/5 Inch from A to G, and 12 Inches from
G to F; the Distance of G above c is 11/2 Inch, the
brass Pulley H is 1/2 Inch Diameter; all the other
Parts of the Machine are of Oak. The main Support or Pillar PQ is 1 Inch square, 21/2 Feet high,
and at Bottom is let thro' a Groove at Q made in a
great heavy Block or Pedestal of Wood RS. In
this Groove the Pillar may be raised higher or lower,
in order to adjust the Height of the Pillar to the Situation, which the Bottom of the Rod AB may require in different Experiments; and it is to be fixed
in that Place by a Screw at T, which goes thro' the
Front of the Block, and presses against the Bottom
of the Pillar.
Fig. 3. represents the Dial-Plate, or Front of the
Plate mark'd MNO: In Fig. 2. it is a Plate of
Brass, with strong Paper glued upon it, and may
be of what Size you please; mine is 11 Inches
over.
AB is the Hand or Index, which slips on very
stiff upon the Axis C, that carries the Pulley H in
Fig. 2. The outer Circle is to be left wide enough
to contain the chemical Characters or Marks which
are to be made upon it, the Arch DE contains the
Divisions of Fahrenheit's Mercurial Thermometer;
the Arc FG those of Reaumur, or the Spirit of
Wine Thermometer.
In order to adjust this Instrument for Use I place
the Bottom of the Rod B in Fig. 2. immersed up
to the Mark ~ in cold River or Rain-Water, in a
Vessel proper to be set over the Fire; and when it
</page>
<page id="689">
has boiled for a Quarter of an Hour, I turn the Index AB in Fig. 3. till it stands in the horizontal
Position, as at B, being the Point of boiling-hot
Water, and which answers to Division 212 on Fahrenheit's Arch. I then take it out of the Water,
and dry it, by holding it a little over the Fire: And
now great Care must be taken, that nothing alters
the Situation of the Index upon the Axis; even a
Nut to screw on upon the Axis at C may be the
best to keep it fixed. If the Instrument be left to
cool in the Air, the Index will fall below B, shewing
the Degrees of Cold, or less Heat than boiling Water; and if put into melting Tin, Lead, &amp;c. it will
shew the Degrees of Heat above boiling Water. A
brass Rod will serve for an Instrument to measure
the greatest Degrees of Cold, and all the Degrees of
Heat, to the melting of Silver or Gold; but if you
have a Mind to make one to measure greater Degrees of Heat, the Rod must be of Steel, or the finest
Iron. A Rod of Brass, according to Dr. Muschen.
broek's Experiments, l. c. was found to lengthen
377, when one of Iron lengthen'd only 230 Parts.
An iron Rod, being regulated by boiling Water, as
above directed, will measure not only the Heat of
melted Tin and Lead, but of Silver, Gold, and Copper, and will even shew the Degree when Iron itself
begins to melt, which will be the greatest Degree
of Elongation of the Rod just before the Bottom of
it runs; and I imagine, that an Instrument may be
constructed with Supporters, and a Rod made of
Tobacco-pipe Clay, which, being regulated by boiling Mercury (for it must never touch Water), may
</page>
<page id="690">
be adapted to measure still greater Degrees of Heat,
till the Materials themselves melt into Glass.
I should advise, that not only the Scale of this
sort of Thermometer, but likewise of all others, be
determined by Experiments, without regarding any
Equality as to Measure between the Divisions, and
that in every Individual that shall be made; for a
Difference in the Length and Thickness of the
Rods in this sort will make a Difference in the Scale,
as much or more than the Inequality in the Cavity
of the Stem, or glass Tube of other Thermometers,
which can never be just, if applied to a Scale whose
Divisions are made equal; unless the Cavity of the
Stem be perfectly equal, which it is impossible for
any Workman to undertake to do, and which is very
seldom, if ever, hit on by chance. Therefore, in
these Instruments, let the Point B in Fig. 3. or the
horizontal Position of the Index, be the Situation of
the Index when the Rod has stood a Quarter of an
Hour in boiling Water; there mark ~ boiling on the
outer Circle; on Fahrenheit's Arch mark 212. then
set your Machine up to the Mark + into melting

Rod is arrived to its greatest Elongation in that Metal, inscribe the Character ~ on the outer Circle;
do the like with Lead, and set the Character ~ at it.

As the Divisions pointed out by the Index will be
different with Rods of different Metals or Substances,
you may make different Circles upon the Plate for
the Range of the different Rods, and mark them;
the Iron Rod, the Brass Rod, the Clay Rod; and
set the several Marks above specified upon each Circle apart; or you may, to avoid Confusion, have a
different Instrument for each kind of Rod.
Being obliged to take down my Athanor and
Wind-Furnace, upon removing twice to different
Houses, and not having rebuilt them where I now
live, I have not had Opportunities yet of fixing the
Scale of my own Instrument, which was one Reason why I did not publish an Account of my Invention sooner; for I hope hereafter to be able to compare the Degrees of Heat necessary for the melting
of each Metal, and to determine the Question whether Metals in the highest Degree of Fusion are susceptible of greater Degrees of Heat by increasing the
Fire, as Water thoroughly boiling can never ~be
made hotter; nor did I intend to have publish'd
any Description of this Instrument till I had completed Tables of the Degrees of Cold and Heat, from
Fahrenheit's Experiment of Cold produced by Art
40 Degrees below 0 to the Heat of melting Iron.
According to Fahrenheit's Scale, the Heat of the
strongest Sunshine is at about 80. Spirit of Wine
boils at 176. Water at 212. the Lixivium of Salt
ofTartar at 240. Spirit of Nitre at 242. Oil of Vitriol
at 546. Quicksilver at 600 *.

As all chemical Digestions, where an equable
Heat is to be continued for some time together, will
come in between hot Sunshine and the boiling of
Quicksilver, a Thermoscope of that Range will be
sufficient for common Uses; and therefore one fitted with a brass Rod will answer these Purposes.
In large Furnaces for running down Ores, or
melting great Quantities of Metal together, it is not
possible to place such an Instrument; but then in
Lead and Tin there may be small Outlets contrived,
into which some of the melted Metal may be permitted to flow, and remain in Contact with the same Body
of Metal within, where the Instrument may be placed;
and for placing a Thermoscope in Iron, Copper, or
Glass Furnaces, there may be a Place contrived, which
shall not open into the Furnace, but have the Thickness
of a Stone or Brick left between, upon which the Instrument may be plac'd; and tho' in such a Situation
it will not measure the actual Heat within the Furnace, it will always give the relative or comparative
Heat in the like Circumstances at different Times,
and so shew us how to regulate the Heat within.
Altho' a Chemist shall have one of these Instruments to measure the Heat, he shall have used in
any Experiment, and have noted down the several
Degrees made use of, and the Time each lasted, he
still labours under another Difficulty, which is the
not being able to command any required Heat, and
that it shall last a certain required Time, unless it
be below that of boiling Water, which may be procured and continued by various Contrivances of
Lamps, either of Spirits, or of Oil; but how to continue a Fire for 12 or 24 Hours together, without Attendance, which shall continually keep Quicksilver

boiling, Lead in Fusion, or may be let down so
low as not to exceed the Heat of Sunshine, and then
be raised again, and that without letting out the
Fire, or moving the Vessels, may seem almost impracticable; but by an Improvement of the Furnace the
antient Chemists call'd their Athanor, I hope to
succeed in it, which may be the Subject of another
Paper.
The Rev. Stephen Hales D. D. that most worthy
Member of the Royal Society, to whom the World
is greatly indebted for many accurate Experiments,
and useful Discoveries, upon hearing the Minutes of
my Paper deliver'd in to the Royal Society, on May
8. 1735. read upon the Thursday following, desired
me to lend him the Original for some Days, telling
me he had some Thoughts of making a Thermoscope with a Rod of Lead. After a few Days he returned me my Paper, with the following obliging
Letter, and kind Remarks.
SIR,
IHAVE read over your Thermometrical Tract with
Satisfaction, and believe it will be of good Use.
The Want of ascertaining the Degrees of Heat and
Cold is a great and important Desideratum in Experimental Philosophy.
What I intended to do was only this, viz. to get a
leaden Wire, of such a Size and Strength as to bear its
own Weight, to have it as long as the longest
Gun-barrel I could procure, and to have it sustain a
Lever as you have done; then to pour boiling Water into the Barrel, for a long time, till the Lever
</page>
<page id="694">
rises no more; the Water to have Vent at the Bottom, yet so as to have the Gun-barrel always full
of Water; the Breech-Pin to be out, and the leaden
Rod to rest on a Piece of Wood set upright, according to the Cource of its Fibres, not sideways.
To give at the same time to a Mercurial Thermometer the Heat of boiling Water.
Then to take the freezing Point of the Leaden
and Mercurial Thermometers; and afterwards to
graduate all the intermediate Degrees, from the
Mercurial Thermometer upon the Leaden Thermo
meter, as they occur.
Thus a Standard Thermometer may be made to
graduate others by; but I will not now set about
it, since you have undertaken the Subject.
His Remarks on the foregoing Paper.
Page. 673. Thermometers must be of excellent
Use in Garden-Stoves; but foreign Plants must not
be kept in an equal Degree of Heat in Stoves, to
that of their native Country; viz. because they cannot bear as great a Heat in a confined close Air,
as in an open free Air. I have been told of CoffeeTrees being killed here in England by this Mistake:
Such Plants must doubtless be kept warm *, but not
so warm as in their native Country.
P.
*I should think it best to lessen the Heat in Stoves towards the Night,
and so to keep the Plants exposed to less Degrees of Heat a-nights than
a-days, nay to vary the Heat daily, or to endeavour by Art to procure
different Degrees of Heat, agreeable to the natural Vicissitudes of the
Climate the Plants come from, having Regard both to the Seasons of
the Year, and the State of flowering or Fructification of the Plants; so
that the best Way of ranging Plants in Green-houses or Stoves is according to the Climates they come from; for which Mr. Sheldrake's Tables
above-mentioned, p. 674. must be of excellent Use. C. M.</page>

P. 676. [All solid Bodies are observed to contract
with Cold.] I have found that Wood does not contract
or dilate lengthways with Heat or Cold. I am told
that Mr. George Graham [is about making] this
Experiment, as I am also, in order to regulate Pendulums.
P. 682. I fear that Boerhaave's wet Linen, which
is so thin, may begin to freeze before all the Mercury or Spirit of Wine in the Ball of the Thermometer has the same Degree of Cold: Tho' hanging
there long before and after freezing will bring it
pretty near.
P. 683. [A Rod of Iron 3 Feet long will have
about 1/4 Inch Increase] or 1/144th Part.
