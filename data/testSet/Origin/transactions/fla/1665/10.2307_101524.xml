<page>Articles of Inquiries touching Mines.
What the Honourable Robert Boyle gave the Reader cause to
hope for, in Numb. II. when he was pleased to impart those General Heads for a Natural History of a Country, there publish'd;
He is not un-mindful to perform, by enlarging them as occasion
serves,with Particular and Subordinate Inquiries. Here he gratifies the Curious with a considerable Set of Inquiries about
Mines: which though unfinish'd, yet the Publisher, was instant
to obtain their present Publication,to the end, that he might the
more conveniently recommend them to several Forreigners of his
Acquaintance, now ready to return to their several Countryes,
which he understands to abound in Mines; and from the Curious Inhabitants whereof, he expects to receive a good Accompt
upon some at least of these Inquiries; which also by several
of them have been earnestly desired, as Instructions, to direct
them, what Particulars to inquire after upon this Subject.
These Quaeries are reduced by the Author to six Heads:
The first, The neighbouring Country about the Mines.
The second, The Soyl where the Mines are.
The third, The Signs of Mines.
The fourth, The Structure and other particulars belonging to
the Mines themselves.
The fifth, The Nature and Circumstances of the Ore.
The sixth, the Reduction of the Ore into Metal.

QUAERIES
About the first Title.
1. Whether the Country be Mountainous, Plain, or distinguish'd with Vales? And in case it be mountainous, what kind
of Hills they are; whether high, or low, or indifferently
elevated? Whether almost equal or very un-e qual in height?
Whether fruitful or barren; cold or temperate; rocky or not;
hollow or solid? Whether they run in ridges, or seem confusedly placed; and, if the former, what way the ridges run,
North and South, &amp;c. And whether they run any thing parallel
to one another?
2. Whether the Country be barren or fruitful? And, if any
way fruitful, what it produces, and what it most abounds
with?
3. What Cattle it nourishes, and whether they have any such
thing peculiar in point of bigness, colour, shape, longaevity,
fitness or unfitness to make good meat, &amp;c. as may be rather adscribed to the peculiar nature of the place, than to the barrenness of the Soyl, or other manifest causes?
4. Whether the Natives, and other Inhabitants, live longer
or shorter than ordinary? Whether they live more or less healthy? Whether they be subject to any Epidemical Diseases, that
may very probably be imputed to the Mines; and what these
Diseases are; and what Remedies are found successful?
5. Whether the Country be, or be not furnish'd with Rivers,
Brooks, Springs, and other Waters; and how these waters are
conditioned?
6. Whether the Air be dry or moist; hot or cold; clear or
foggy; thick or thin; heavy or light; and especially, whether the Weather be more or less variable than ordinarily; or
whether it be subject to great and sudden changes, that may
probably be imputed to the Mineral and Subterraneous Steams;
and what they are?

About the second Title.
7. Whether the Soyle that is neer the Surface of the Earth,
be Stony; and, if it be, what kind of Stones it abounds with?
Whether it be Clayie, Marley, Chalkye, &amp;c. And, if it be
of several kinds, how many they are; and by what properties they are distinguish'd?
About the third Title.
8. By what Signs they know or guess, that there is a Mine in
such a place?
9. These Signs are either upon the Surface of the Earth, or
beneath it.
To the former belong these Quaeries.
10. Whether the Ground be made barren by Metalline or
Mineral Effluviums?
11. Whether it be observed, that Trees and other greater
Plants seem to have their tops burnt, or other leaves or outsides
discoloured? or whether there be any Plants, that do affect to
grow over such Mines; and whether it have been tryed, that
other Plants, that would prosper in the adjacent places, will
not be made to grow or thrive there?
12. Whether the Stones and Pebles, that are wash'd by the
Brooks, Springs, or other Waters, have any colour'd substance left upon them; and if they have, of what colour,
weight, &amp;c. these adherences are?
13. Whether the Waters of the place proposed, do by their
tast, smell, ponderousness, &amp;c. disclose themselves to contain
Minerals? And, if they do, what Minerals they or their residences, when they are evapourated away, do appear to abound with, or to participate of?
14. Whether Snow will not lye, or Frost continue so long,
or Dew be generated or stay upon the ground in the place proposed, as on other neighbouring grounds?
15. Whether the Dew that falls on that ground, will discolour white Linnen or Woollen-Cloths, spred over night on the
</page>
<page id="333">
surface of the ground, and employed to collect the Dew? And
whether the Rain that falls there, and may be supposed to come
thither from elsewhere, will discolour such Clothes, or afford
any residence of a Mineral Nature?
16. Whether the Place be more than ordinarily subject to
Thunder and Lightning, and to sudden Storms or Earthquakes;
as likewise to Nocturnal Lights and fiery Meteors.
17. Whether Mists use to rise from Grounds stored with Minerals? What is observable in them, and what Minerals they
signify, and may be supposed to be produced by?
18. Whether the Virgula Divinatoria be used to find out the
Veins of proposed Mines; and, if it be, with what success?
19. What other Signs above ground afford probability of
Mines, or Direction for following a Vein over Hills, Valleys,
Lakes, Rivers, &amp;c.
The second sort of Signs belonging to these Quaeries, are such
as follow.
20. Whether there be any Clayes, Marles, or other Mineral
Earths, yellow or liquid matters, that usually give notice of
the Ore? And if there be more than one, how and at what
depths they are wont to lye respectively? Of what thickness
and consistence they are; and in what Order the Diggers meet
with them?
21. Whether there be any Stones or Marchasites to be found
neer, or not very far from the surface of the ground, by which
one may have ground to expect a Mine? As is often observed in
the Tin-Mines of Cornwall, over which such kind of Stones
are divers times found lying above ground?
22. Whether all Stones of that kind do equally signify that
Mine? And, if not,how the significant Stones are to be known,
as by Colour, Bigness, Shape, Weight, Depth under
ground, &amp;c.
23. Whether there be any Earths of peculiar kinds, as to
Colour, Consistence, &amp;c. that indicate a Mine beneath or near
them; and, if there be, what they are, and what is their consecution, if they have any?
24. Whether Heat or Damps give any assurance or a probability of finding a Mine?
</page>
<page id="334">
25. Whether Water of any kind, met with in Digging,
especially at this or that depth, do betoken a Mine?
26. Whether there be any Signs of the neerness of the Mine,
and what they are?
27. Whether there be any Signs of ones having miss'd the
Mine, either by being past above, or beneath, or having
left it on either hand; and what they are?
28. Whether there be any Signs not only of the distinct and
determinate kind of Metals or Minerals; but of the Plenty and
Goodness of the Vein; and what they are?
29. Whether there be any Signs of the depth of the Vein beneath the surface of the Earth; and what they are?
30. Whether there be any proper or peculiar Signs, that
show it to be hopeless, or at least unlikely, to find a Vein in
the place where it is digg'd for; and what those are?
About the fourth Title.
31. What is the depth of the Shaft or Groove(which though
named in the singular Number, the Questions about it are generally applicable) till you come at the Vein or Ore?
32. Whether the Vein run or lye Horizontal, or dippe? And
if it dippe, what inclination it hath, how deep the lowest part
lies; and consequently how much deeper than the uppermost?
As also, what it's Flexures, if it have any, are? And whether
it runs directly North or South, East or West; or seem rather to
have a Casual tendency, than any determinate one by Nature?
and how far it reaches in all?
33. What is the Wideness of the Groove at the Top, and
elsewhere? Whether the Groove be perpendicular or crooked;
and if crooked, after what manner, and with what distance it
winds?
34. How the Groove is supported? What are the kinds,
length, bigness, and way of placing the Timber, Poles, &amp;c.
that are employed to support it? And how long the Wood will
last, without being spoyled with the subterraneous fumes and
waters? and what wood lasts longest?
</page>
<page id="335">
75. What Air-shaft belongs to the Mine? Whether it be
single, or more than One? Of what breadth the Air-shaft is at
the Orifice? Whether it be convenient enough, or not? How
neer it is placed to the Groove; and in what position? And if
there be several Air-shafts, what their Distances and scituation
are in reference to the Groove, and to each other? Or how Air
is supplied, if there be no Air-shafts?
36. Whether they meet with any Waters in the Mine? And,
if they do, how copious they are; at what depths they occur;
how they are qualified; and what way they Spring, &amp;c.
37. Whether they are constant or temporary? whether they
increase or diminish notably in Summer or Winter, or at any
other time of the year; and if they do, at what season that is;
how long it is wont to last; and the proportions of Increase and
Decrease?
38. What Expedients and Engines are employed to free the
Mines from Water? The materials, the parts, the bigness,the
shapes, the coaptation; and, in short, the whole structure,
number, and way of applying the Instruments, that are made
use off to free the Mines from Water?
39. What are the Conditions, Number, &amp;c. of the Adits?
40. VVhether the Mine be troubled with Damps, and of
what kind they are? whether they come often or seldom at any
set time, or altogether irregularly? what Signs fore-run them?
what mischief they do? what remedies are the most successfully
imployed against them, aswell in reference to the Cleering of
the Mine, as to the Preservation and Recovery of the VVorkmen?
41. VVhat Methods the Mine-men use in following the Vein,
and tracing their passages under ground (which they call Plumming and Dyalling) according to the several exigencies? And
whether they employ the Instruments,made with the help of the
Load-stone, the same way that is usual; and if not, wherein
they differ in the use of the same Instruments; or what Instruments they substitute in their place?
42. VVhat ways they take to secure themselves from the uncertainty, incident to the guidance of Magnetick Needles from
the Iron-Stone or Ore, that they may meet with under ground?
</page>
<page id="336">
(of which yet perhaps there is not so great danger, as one may
imagine; as far as I could find by a Trial, I purposely made
in a Groove, where I was sure, there wanted not Iron-Ore.)
And what other wayes may be used to direct Miners without the
help of a Load-stone?
43. How the Miners deal with the Rocks and Sparrs, they
often meet with, before they come at the Ore? Whether they
use Fire to soften, calcine, or crack them? How they employ
it, and with what measure of success?
44. What wayes and cautions they use, to free the Mine
and secure the Work-men from the inconveniencies and danger accruing from the use of much fire in it?
45. What Instruments they use to break the Rock &amp;c? And
how those Instruments are conducive; and how long they last?
46. How the Mine-men work; whether naked or cloathed?
And what Lights they use to work by; what materials they
are made of, what measure of light they give; how long they
last; and by what wayes they are kept burning in that thick
and foggy air?
47. How Veins are follow'd, lost, and recover'd? And how
several Miners work on the same Vein? And what is the best
way of getting all the Ore in a Vein, and most conveniently?
48. How they convey out their Ore, and other things, that
are to be carried out of the Mine? Whether they do it in
Baskets drawn up by Ropes, or upon Mens backs; and if this
last-named way; what kind of Vessels they use for matter,
shape, and capacity? And whether the Work-men deliver
them one to another; or the same Work-men carry them all the
way? And whether the Diggers descend and ascend by Ladders
of Wood, or of Ropes, &amp;c.
About the Fifth Title.
49. Whether the Ore runs in a Vein; or lie dispers'd in
scatter'd pieces; or be divided partly into a Vein, and partly
into loose masses; or like a Wall between two Rocks, as it were
in a Cleft; or be interspers'd in the firm Rock; like speckled
Marble? Or be found in Grains like Sand or Gravel; as store
</page>
<page id="337">
of excellent Tin is said to be found in some parts of Cornwall at
the Sides and in the Channels of running Waters, which they
call.......; or whether the Ore be of a softer consistence, like
Earth or Lome, as there is Lead-ore in Ireland holding store
of Silver, and Iron-ore in the North parts of Scotland and elsewhere? And what is observable in it as to Weight, Colour,
Mixture, &amp;c?
50. Whether any part of the Metal be found in the Mine perfect and complete? (As I have had presented me good valluable Copper, and pieces of perfect Lead, that were taken up,
the one at Jamaica, and the other by an acquaintance of mine,
that took them out of the ground himself in New England.)
51. Whether the Mine affords any parcels of Metal, that
seem to grow like Plants (as I have sometimes seen Silver growing, as it seemed, out of Stone, or Sparre almost like blades of
Grass; as also great Grains of a Metal, which appear'd to me,
and which those, that tryed some of it, affirmed to be Gold,
abounding in a stony lump, that seem'd to consist chiefly of a
peculiar kind of Sparre.)
52. VVhether the Vein lie near, or much beneath the surface of the Earth, and at what depth?
53. VVhether the Vein have or have not any particular Concomitants, or Coats (if I may so call them;) and, if any, what
they are, and in what order they lie? (As the Veins of Leadore, with us, have frequently annnext to them a Substance
call'd Sparre, and next to that another, call'd Caulk.
54. VVhether (besides these Coats) the Vein have belonging to it any other Hcterogeneous substance? (As in Tin-mines
we often find that yellow substance, which they call Mundick.)
55. VVhat are the principal Qualities of these Extraneous
substances? (As that Sparre is white, but transparent, almost
like course Crystall, heavy, britle, easily divisible into
flakes, &amp;c. Caulk is of a different texture, white, opacous, and
like a Stone, but much more ponderous. Mundick I have had
of a fine golden colour; but, though it be affirm'd to hold no
Metal; yet I found it in weight, and otherwise, to differ from
Marchasites; and the Mine-men think it of a poisonous nature.)
</page>
<page id="338">
56. Whether the Vein be inclosed every way in its Coats; or
whether it only lye between them?
57. Whether the Vein be every way of an uniform breadth,
and thickness; and, if it be, what these Dimensions are; and,
if not, in what places it varies, and in what measures? (The
like Questions are to be made concerning the Sparre, Caulk, and
other Teguments or mixtures of the Ore?)
58. VVhether the Vein be un-interrupted, or in some places
broken off; and whether it be abruptly, or not; and whether
it be by Vales, Brooks, Gullets, etc.
59. How wide the Interruptions are? what Signs, whereby
to find the Vein again? whether the ulteriour part or division
of the Vein be of the same Nature, and hold on in the same
Course, as to its tendency upwards or downwards, or Horizontally, Norward, Southward, &amp;c. with the Vein, from
which it is cut off?
60. VVhether, in case the last end of the Vein be found, it
terminate abruptly, or else end in some peculiar kind of Rock
or Earth, which does, as it were, close or Seal it up, without
leaving any crack or cranny, or otherwise? And whether the
terminating part of the Vein tend upwards, downwards, or
neither? And whether in the places, where the Vein is interrupted, there be any peculiar Stone or Earth, that does, as it were,
seal up the Extremity of it?
61. Whether it be observed, that the Ore in Tract of time
may be brought to afford any Silver or Gold, which it doth not
afford, or more than it would afford, if it were not so ripe?
And whether it have been found, that the Metalline part of the
Vein grows so, that some part of the Mine will afford Ore or
Metalin tract of time, that did not so before? And whether to
this Maturation of the Mine, the being exposed to the free
Air be necessary; or, whether at least it conduce to the Acceleration of it; or otherwise?
62. Whether all the Ore, contained in the Mine, be of the
self-same nature and goodness; and, if not, what are the
differing kinds; and how to be discriminated and estimated?
63. VVhat is the fineness and goodness of the Ore, by which
the Mine is wont to be estimated? And what are the marks and
</page>
<page id="339">
characters, that distinguish one sort from another?
64. VVhat proportion of Metal it affords? (As in our Ironmines 'tis observed, that about three Tuns of Iron-stone will afford one Tun of Metal: And I have had Lead-Ore, which an
Ingenious man, to whom I recommended such Tryals, affirm'd
to me to afford three parts in four of gcod Lead.)
65. VVhether the Ore be pure in its kind from other Metals,
and, if not, of what Metals it participates; and in what proportion? Which is especially to be inquired into, in cafe
the Mine be of a base metal, that holds a noble metal metal:
(As I have known it observ'd, that Lead-Ore, that is poor
in its own metal, affords more Silver, than other; and I remember, that the Ore lately mention'd, being rich in Lead,
scarce afforded us upon the Cuppel, an Atome of Silver. And
Matthestus informs us, that a little Gold is not unfrequently
found in Iron-Ore. And I have by me some Gold, that never
endur'd the Fire, taken out of a Lump of Tin-Ore.)
About the sixth Title.
66. VVhat are the mechanick and praevious Operations, as
Beating, Grinding, VVashing, &amp;c. that are used to separate
the Ore from the Heterogeneous Bodies, and prepare it for the
Fire? Or whether the Ore requires no such preparation? (as it
often happens in Lead, and sometimes in Iron, &amp;c.)
67. VVhether Mercury be made use off, to extract the nobler
from the baser metals? (as is their practice in Peru, and other
parts of the West-Indies.)
68. VVhether the leaving the Ore expos'd to the open Air
and Rain for a good while, be used as a Praeparative? (as I
have seen done in Iron-stone.)
69. VVhether the Burning and Beating of the Ore be used
to prepare it for the Furnace? (as is practised in Iron, and almost always in Copper:) And, in case they use it more than once,
how often they do it; (for, Copper-Ore is in some places washed
8. or 10. times, and in others, 12. or 14.) and with what circumstances; as, how long the Ignition lasts at a time, whether
the Ore be suffer'd to cool of it self, or be quench'd? whether
it be washed betwixt each Ignition?
70. VVhat Flux-powders, and other ways they have to try
</page>
<page id="340">
and examine the goodness of the Ore in small quantities?
71. VVhether, when they work in great, they use to melt
the Ore with any Flux or Additaments, or only by the force of
the Fire, or in any way between both? (As throwing in of
Charcoals when they melt Iron-stone does not only serve to feed
the Fire, but perhaps by the Alchaly of its Ashes to promote
the fusior: so Lime-stone, &amp;c.)
72. What kind of Furnaces they use, to melt the Ore in?
Whether they be all of one sort and bigness, or of differing?
73. What are, the Situation, Materials, Dimensions, Shape,
Bigness, and in short what is the whole structure and Contrivance of the Furnace? If there be any thing peculiar and remarkable? VVhat Tools are used in Smelting, their Figures, use, &amp;c.
And the wholemanner of working?
74. VVhat kinds of Fewel,and what quantities of it, are wont
to be employed in the Furnace, within the compass of a day,
or week? How much is put in at a time? How often it is renewed? And how much Ore in a determinate time, as a week
or a day, is wont to be reduced to Metal?
75. In case an Additament be employed, what that is, and
in what proportion it is added? VVhether it be mingled with
the Ore, before that be put into the Fire, or cast in afterwards; and, if so, at what time, &amp;c?
78. VVhether the Ore be melted by a VVind, excited by the
Fire it self; as in VVind-ovens? Ore by the course of VVaters? Or acuated by the blast of Bellows; and, if so, whether
these Bellows be mov'd by a VVheel, turn'd by VVater running under it, or falling on it? And what are, the Dimensions,
Situation, &amp;c. of the Bellows?
79. VVhat contrivance they have, to let or take out the
Metal, that is in fusion; and cast it into Barrs, Sows, Pigs. &amp;c?
80. VVhat Clay, Sand, or Mould they let it run or pour it
through? And after what manner they refrigerate it?
81. VVhether or no they do, either to facilitate the fusion,
or to obtain the more or better Metal, mingle differing sorts
or degrees of Ore of the same metal? (As in some places 'tis
usual, to mingle poor and rich Ore; and at Mendip they mix two
or more of those differing kinds of Lead-orethat they call Frimore, Steel-ore, Potern-ore, &amp;c.)
</page>
<page id="341">
82. VVhether or no, having once brought the Ore to fusion, they melt all the Metal it self, to have it the more pure?
And, if they do, with what circumstances they make the fusion?
83. VVhether they have any Signs, whereby to know whether the Fusion have been well or ill perform'd; and the Metal
have obtain'd the perfection, to be expected from such Ore,
melted in such a Furnace?
84. VVhether they observe any great difference in the
goodness of the Metal, that first melts, from that of the rest of
the Metal which comes afterwards in the same or another operation? And whether the Rule holds constantly? (For, though
they observe in Tin-Mines, the best Metal comes first, yet in the
works of an Industrious friend of mine, he informs me, that the
best Metal comes last.)
85. Whether the produced Metal be all of the same goodness?
And if it be, how good it is in reference to the Metal of other
Mines, or other parts of the same Mine or Vein? And if it benot,
what differences are observ'd between the produced portions
of Metal; and what disparity that amounts to in the price?
86. What are the Wayes of distinguishing them, and estimating their goodness?
87. Whether they do any thing to the Metal, after it is
once brought to Fusion, and, if need be, melt it over again,
to give it a melioration? (As when Iron is refined, and turn'd
into Steel;) And what distinct Furnaces, and peculiar Ways
of ordering the Metals are employ'd to effect this improvement?
With a full description of them and the Tools in all Circumstances, observ'd in the refining of Metals.
88. Whether in those places, where the Metal is melted,
there be not elevated some Corpuscles, that stick to the upper
parts of the Furnance, or Building? And, if there be, whether they be barely fuliginous and recrementitious exhalations,
or, at least in part, Metallin Flowers? (As in the Cornish Tinmines, after some years they usually destroy the thatch'd
Houses, where the Ore hath been melted, to get the stuff, that
adhears to the insides of the Roofs, out of which they melt store
of excellent Tin.)
89. Whether the Metal, being brought to fusion, affords
</page>
<page id="342">
any Recrements? (As Iron-stone affords store of a dark Glass
or Slagg) And, if it do, what those Recrements are? How
they are separated from the Metal; and to what Uses they are
employed?
90. Whether, after the Metal has been once melted, the
remaining part of the Ore being exposed to the Air, will in
tract of time be impregnated, or ripen'd, so as to afford more
Metal? (For, this is affirm'd to me of the Cornish Tin-Ore;
and what remained after the fusion of Iron-ore in the Forest of
Dean, is so rich in Metal, that a Tenant of mine in Ireland,
though he had on the Land, he held from me, an Iron-Mine,
found it less profit to work it, than to send cross the Sea to the
Forest of Dean for this already us'd Ore, which having lain for
some ages, since it was thrown aside in great heaps expos'd to
the Air, he affirm'd to yield as well great great store of Iron,
as very good: though I somewhat doubt, whether this be totally to be ascribed to the Aire, and length of time; or to the
leaving of Metal in the Slaggs in old times, before great Furnaces were in use.)
Promiscuous Inquiries about Mines, from the
same Author.
1. Whether the Territorie, that bears the Mine, abounds
with no other Kind of Mineral in some distinct part of it? (As
in Kent near Tunbridge, one part of the Country which is Hilly,
abounds all along with Iron-Mines; the other, which is also
Hilly, and divided from it but by a small Valley, abounds exceedingly (as the Diggers and Inhabitants told me upon the
place) in Quarry's, which the Metallin-Country wants, but is
quite destitute of Iron-stone. And so at Mendip, in one part
of the Hill, I saw store of Lead-Mines, containing several
Kinds of Ore of that Metal; another part of the Hill I found to
be full of Cole-pits, which had some Marchasites, but no Metal;
and in another place, Iron-ore, and mixt with Ores, which
yet they did not think fit to work.)
2. Whether the Air appear to be really cold in Summer,
</page>
<page id="343">
and hot in Winter at the bottom of the Mines, by surer proofs
than the Testimony of our Touch?
3. Whether they ever meet with places and Stones actually
very hot, as Matthesius relates? And whether that spring not
from the quenching of Marchasites?
4. Whether they find in the Mines any Mineral Gelly, such
as the German Naturalists call Ghur? And whether in process of
time it will harden into a metal, or Mineral Concretion?
5. What are the Laws, Constitutions,and Customs, Oeconomical, Political, Ethical, that are receiv'd and practis'd among the
Mine-men?
6. Whether the Diggers do ever really meet with any subterraneous Daemons; and if they do, in what shape and manner
they appear; what they portend; and what they do,&amp;c?
7. Whether they observe in the Trees and other Plants,
growing over or neer the Mine, not only, (as hath been already intimated) that the Leaves are any whit gilded or silver'd
by the ascending Mineral Exhalations, but also, that the Trees
or other Plants are more solid and ponderous? And if they have
not also some discernable Metalline or Mineral Concretes, to
be met with in the small Cavities and Pores of their substance?
8. Whether there be not Springs, and also greater Streams
of Water neer the Mine, that rise, and run their whole course
under ground, without ever appearing above it?
9. Whether the Subterraneous Springs do rise with any wind
or determinate change of weather?
10. How much heavier the Atmosphere is at the bottom of
the Mine, than at the top? And whether Damps considerably
increase the weight of it?
11. Whether they find any strange substances in the Mines,
asVessels, Anchors, Fishes inclos'd in Sparr or Metal, &amp;c.?
