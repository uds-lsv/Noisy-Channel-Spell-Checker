An Account of some Books.
1. FREE CONSIDERATIONS about SUBORDINATE, FORMS, by the Honourable ROBERT
BOYLE.
THis Tract is an Appendix to the Noble Author's Examen
of Substantial Forms, published last year, and reprinted this.
There hath been already given an Account of the principal
Part, as appears by Numb. II. 'Tis very fit the like should be
done now of this considerable Appendix:
First then it clears up and states the Doctrine about Subordinate Forms, as it is maintain'd by divers learned Moderns, especially Sennertus, who teacheth, that besides the Specifick Form,
(so called by him) there may reside in Animals and Plants, certain other Forms, so subject to the predominant Mistress-Form,
that they deserve the Title but of Subordinate Forms, and during the Reign of the Specifick, are subservient to it; yet when
that is deposed or abolisht, these Inferiour Forms may come to
set up for themselves, viz.
This done, the Author tryes, whether the Phaenomena and
Effects of these pretended Subordinate Forms may not be as
well as the principal ones, intelligibly explicated by the Mechanical Principles, vid. Matter and Motion, and the thence resulting
Shape and Texture. Which that it may be done, is so happily
made out in this Tract, that a Rational Unprejudiced and Attentive Reader cannot but embrace the Author's Doctrine, and,
according to it, be satisfied, that the portions of Matter, that
are endowed with these pretended Subordinate Forms, cannot pay
the presumed Superintendent Form any other obedience, than
some such kind of one, as the parts of a Clock or Engine may be
said to yield to one another. So that the whole matter may be
well conceived to be nothing but this; That, when divers bedies of differing natures or Schematisms come to be associated so
as to compose a Body of one denomination, though each of them
be supposed to act according to its own peculiar nature, yet by
reason of the coaptation of those parts, and the contrivement
of the compounded Body, it will many times happen, that the
</page>
<page id="533">
action or effect produced, will be of a mixed nature, and differing
from that, which several of the parts consider'd as distinct Bodies
or Agents, tended to, or would have perform'd; As when in a
Ballance, by putting in a weight into one of the Scales,the opposite Scale, though as a heavy body it will naturally tend downwards, yet by vertue of the fabrick of the Instrument is made to
mount upwards. So that those Actions, which Scholastical men
attribute to the conspiring of subordinate Forms to assist the Specifick, are but the resultant actions of several Bodies, which being
associated together, are thereby reduced in many cases to act
jointly, and mutually modifie each others actions;and that which
they ascribe to the dominion of the Presiding Form, is to be imputed to the structure and connexion of the parts of the compounded body.
This the Author confirms and illustrates by many very instructive Examples and Comparisons, taken from manual Arts and
Practises, Physicks, Chymistry,&amp;c, And applying his droctrine about these subordinate Forms to inanimate Bodies, he sums up the
heads of all,and casts them into 9 distinct Propositions, which are
1. The word Form is of an interminate signification.
2. 'T is not easie, to decide the Nobleness of Forms.
3. In divers Bodies the Form is attributed upon the account of
some eminent Property or Use; which if it be present and continue,
though many other things supervene, or chance to be wanting,
the matter is nevertheless lookt upon, as retaining its Form,and
is wont to be allow'd its usual denomination.
4. By reason of the Conjunction or Connexion of the parts,
that make up a whole (or, at least an Aggregate of Bodies, that
for their connexion are looked upon as such) it willoften happen,
that several things will be perform'd by the joint or concurrent
Action of these united or coherent parts.
5. We may yet in a sound sense admit,that in some Bodies there
may be subordinate Forms.
6. The supervening of a new Form is often but accidental to
the Pre-existent Form, and (then) does not at all destroy its nature but modifie its operations.
7. Besides the Specifick actions of a Body, that harbours subordinate Forms, there may be divers others, wherein some of the
</page>
<page id="534">
Parts or Ingredients may act according to their particular and
pristine nature.
8. In divers Bodies, that which is call'd or look'd upon as the
Specifick Form,is often not so much as the Presiding, but only the
most eminent.
9. The forms discoursed of, seem to be rather concurrent,than
subordinate.
To each of these Propositions are annexed short Comments, full
of very pertinent and teaching Instances,Relations, Comparisons,
&amp;c. for which the Reader is referred to the Book it self.
II. Joh. SWAMMERDAM, M.D. Amsterodamensis de RESPIRATIONE &amp; USU PVLMONuM.
THis Author is of opinion, that all those Philosophers, who
have hitherto inquired into the Nature and use of Respiration, have only caught the shadow of it, nothing of the substance.
And of this he gives this for the chief reason, because they have
been too negligent in considering the first manifest motion of the
Breast and Lungs in a Faetus; which particular being understood
he thinks it very easie to judge of the Respiration of born Animals.
He scruples not to reprehend the immortal Doctor Harvey, for
having excluded from the office of the Lungs the use of Refrigeration; which he pretends to have asserted himself by most evident Experiments, and uncontroulable Reasons.
To represent distinctly, what he undertakes to make out in this
Tract, we may take notice of thse particulars.
1. He takes pains to refute the Doctrine of Attraction, and to
substitute in its place the Doctrine of Pulsion or Intrusion of Air into the Lungs.
2. He endeavours to assert, that the Lungs do not fall down,
but are by the Breast contracted.
3. He affirms, to have clearly shew'd, what is the proper function and work of the Diaphragme, and other Muscles serving
for Respiration.
4. He pretends, to have experimentally evinced the Genuine
use of Respiration, and the Benefit thence resulting to the Animal Life.
</page>
<page id="535">
In short,He makes Respiration to be a Motion of the Thorax
and Lungs, whereby the Air is sometimes implled by the Nose,
Mouth and Wind-pipe into the Lungs; and thence again expelled; farther to elaborate the Blood, by Refrigerating it, and by
seperating its fuliginous steams, and so raise it to its ultimate and
highest perfection, for the Conservation of the Life of Animals.
Notice may be taken here by the by, that this Author in his
Preface promises the publishing of a Treatise about Insects, in
which he ingages to shew many wonderfull things in those little
and seemingly contemptible Creatures, and in particular to demonstrate to the Eye the very method and manner how a Caterpiller is transmuted into a Chrysalis or Aurelia: By performing of
which, he hop eth, he shall make the Curious bear more easily the
loss of Dr. Harvey's Treatise on that Subject.
III. Observations faites sur un GRAND POISON, &amp; un
LION, disseques dans la Bibliotheque du Roy a Paris, le 24. &amp;
le 28. Juin, 1667,
THis Great Fish, dissected by the Parisian Philosophers, was
a Vulpecula Marina (a Sea-fox:) in which they observ'd;
First, The length of his Tail, equalling very near the whole
length of the rest of his body (the whole Fish being 81/2 feet long)
and fashioned after the manner of a Sithe, bowed and turned up
toward the belly.
Secondly, His Mouth was armed with two sorts of Teeth; one
sort in the upper Jaw, being pointed,hard and firm, and of one
only bone, in the manner of a Saw: the other sort, found in the
rest of the upper,and in the whole under-Jaw,were moveable,and
fastned by fleshly membranes.
Thirdly, His Tongue did altogether adhere to the lower Jaw,
and its skin was hard and covered with little shining points,
which rendred it very rough and scabrous one way. The points
viewed with a Miscroscope, appeared transparent like Chrystal.
Fourthly,His Throat was very large,and the Oesophagus, as large
as his Maw; concerning which Authors say,that he hath the dexterity of disengaging himself from the swallowed hook,by casting
it up together with his Maw, the inside of it turned out. They
</page>
<page id="536">
found in his Maw the Sea-herb Vdrec 5 inches long, and a Fish
of the like length without head, scales, skin and guts, all being
wasted but the musculous flesh, which remained entire.
Fifthly, The superior part of his great Gut had this peculiar,
that instead of the usual circumvolutions of Guts, the cavity of
this was divided transversly by many partitions, consisting of the
membranes of the Gut turned inwards,and in the figure of a Vice,
like Snail-shels, or winding Stairs.
Sixthly, His Spleen was double; his Liver divided into two
Lobes; the Gall found to have more of bitter than sower: the
Heart, without a Pericardium, as big as a Hens egge; the Head
almost nothing but a mass of flesh, very little Brains in it, and
that which was there,having very few meanders or windings:the
Eyes, bigger than those of an Ox, only half-spherical, flat before;
the Sclerotica formed like a Cup, very thin, but very hard; the
Cornea very tender and soft; the Chrystallin perfectly spherical;
the Vaea grayish; the Chorodies of the same colour and pierced,
for the production of the Retina, by a very large hole: the bottom of this Chorodies had that lustre of Mother of Pearl, which is
found in Terrestrial Animals,but with less vivid colours: and the
Retina was also streaked with very apparent sanguineous Vessels.
The observables in the Lyon were,
In General, that for outward shape, and the constitution of many parts, as the Claws, Teeth, Eyes, Tongue, (besides the likeness
of the Viscera) a Lyon resembles very much a Cat.
In particular, an admirable structure of his Claws; a peculiar
shape and position of his Teeth; a very stiff Neck; a mighty
rough and sharp Tongue, having points like claws both for hardness and shape, Eyes very clear and bright,even after death,which
without closing the Eye-lids, Lyons can cover with a thick and
blackish membrane, placed towards the great Angle, which by
rising it self and reaching towards the small Angle,can extend it
self over the whole Cornea, as tis in Birds,but especially in Catts:
The reverse of the auterior Uvea,where it lies over the Chrystallin,
is altogether black: the Chrystallin very flat, and its greatest convexity,which is not usual,in its anterior part,at tis in Cats: the Aqueous humour very plentifull, equalling almost the sixth part of
the Vitreous, which plenty was judged to be the cause of the bright
nels, that remains in the eyes after death.
</page>
<page id="537">
His Throat was not above an Inch and a half large:the Stomach,
6 inches large, and 18 inches long: all the Guts 25 foot long: the
Liver,divided into 7 Lobes, as in Cats; its cavity under the Bladder of Gall was full of Gall, shed abroad in the substance of the Liver, and of the neighbouring parts; which was suspected by the
Physitians,administring this operation,to have been the cause of
this Lyons death: the Bladder or Call was 7 inches long, and 11/2 inch
large, of a peculiar structure: the Spleen, a foot long, 2 inches
large, and 1/2 inch thick: the Kidney weighed somewhat above 7
ounces: the Genitals of a peculiar conformation,causing this Animal to cast his Urine backwards,and to couple like Camels and
Hares.
His Lungs had 6 Lobes on the right side,and 3 on the left: the
Wind-pipe had its annular Cartilages entire, excepting two or
three; it was above four inches in compass,being very firme,and
by this bgness and firmness enabling a Lyon, strongly to thurst
Air enough through it, for his dread ful roaring.
His Heart was dry,and without water in the Pericard; much
greater in proportion, than of any other Animal,between six inches long,and four inches large towards the basis,and terminating
in a sharp point, It had very little flesh, and was all hollow; the
Ventricles very large; the Auricles very small: the proportion of
the branches, which the ascending Aorta casts out, was such,that
the Carotids were as big,as the left Subclavial branch,and as the
rest of the right Subclavial,whence they issue; Which is considerable,seeing the Brain is so small: For the Brain was but two inches big, of any dimension; the rest of the head being very fleshy,
and consisting of very firm Bones. By comparing the little quantity of the Lyons Brain with the plenty of that of a Calf, it was
Judged, that the having but little Brain is rather a mark and a
cause of a fierce and cruel temper,than want of wit. Which conjecture was strengthened by the observation formerly made in the
Sea-Fox,in whom almost no Brains was found,though it thought,
that his craft and address hath occasioned men to give him that
Name.

IV. HISTORIAAMBRA E, Authore JUSTOKL OB I O, D. in Academ. Wittebergensi.
THis Author reckons up 18 Opinions concerning Ambergreese, and having examined every one of them,he embraces that, which holds, That it is the Dung of a Bird, (called
in the Madagascar Tongue Aschibobuch:) of which he gives the
description out of Odarotus Barbosa and others; who affirm it to be
of the bigness of a Goose, curiously feather'd,with a big head,
well tufted. These Birds being found in great numbers in Madagascar, the Maldives, and other parts of East-Indies,are affirmed by Anthors to flock together in great numbers, as Cranes;
and frequenting high Cliffs near the Sea-side, and there voiding
their Excrement, the Sea washes thence, if it fall not of it self,
into it.
There is another opinion among the said 18, for which the Author hath a good inclination, but yet dares not embrace it; viz.
that 'tis the Excrement of a certain kind of Whales. If this
Amber were but in those other places, where there is good store
of such Whales, it seems that would make the Author relinquish
the former Opinion.
This puts us in mind of a Relation,to be met with in Purchas,
which,giving an Account of a certain Commission for a Gentleman to go Factor into Greenland for the killing of Whales and Morses, takes notice, among other Particulars, of a sort of Whale,
called Trompa, having but one Trunk on his head, whereas the
Sarda,another kind of Whales, hath two. This Trompa(saith that
Author) hath teeth of a span long,and as thick as a mans Wrist,
but no ~. In his Head is the Sperma Ceti, saith he farther,and
in his Entrails, the Ambergreese, being in shape and colour like
Cowes-dung. Express order was given in the said Commission, that
the person deputed should himself be present at the opening of this
sort of Whale,and cause the residue of the said Entrails to be put
in small Casks,and bring them along with him into England.
This will give occasion to increase our Inquires for Greenland;
which perhaps may be inserted in the Book of the next Month.
