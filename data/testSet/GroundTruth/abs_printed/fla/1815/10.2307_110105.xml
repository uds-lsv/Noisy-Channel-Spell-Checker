<page>An Account of the Construction and Adjustment of the New Standards of Weights and Measures of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland. By Captain Henry Kater, F.R.S. Read November 24, 1825. [Phil. Trans. 1826, Part II. p. 1.] The author, after stating that the weights and measures of the United Kingdom are founded on a standard whose length is determined by its proportion to that of a pendulum vibrating mean time in London, which has been ascertained by him to be 39-13929 inches of Sir George Shuckburgh's scale, considers it necessary, on account of the importance of the result, to consider what degree of confidence</page>
<page id="255">it is entitled to. For this purpose it is necessary to compare this final result with those obtained in other experiments and by different methods. Now it appears that previous to the experiments detailed in the author's paper on the subject in the Philosophical Transactions for 1818, on which this result rests, another series is there mentioned, made with the same instruments, but under circumstances which occasioned their rejection, and which, owing to some repairs in the instruments between the two series, which occasioned a material alteration in the distance between the knife edges, have all the weight of experiments made with a different pendulum; the result of these rejected experiments, however, differed only two ten-thousandths of an inch from that ultimately adopted. The author next compares the length of the seconds pendulum at Unst and at Leith Fort, as ascertained by him by an invariable pendulum, whose vibrations had previously been determined in London, and whose length was thus known in terms of the London Seconds Pendulum, and as ascertained by M. Biot at the same stations, by means of a variety of pendulums, and by a totally different method of observation,that of Borda. The results of this comparison are a difference between the determinations of M. Biot and the author, of 0*00029 inch in excess at the former station, and 0*00015 in defect at the latter. From this near agreement of all the results, he considers that the length of the seconds pendulum in London, may be regarded as certainly known to within one ten-thousandth of an inch; while from the near agreement of the results of the French and English experiments on the length of the pendulum, he concludes that the length of the metre in parts of Sir George Shuckburgh's scale, may also be regarded as known within one ten-thousandth of an inch. From an account recently published by Captain Sabine of his valuable experiments for the determination of the variations in length of the seconds pendulum, he observes, doubts may be inferred of the accuracy of the method employed by him for the observations for determining the length of the seconds pendulum in London, as well as in those which have been made with the invariable pendulum. It is asserted there, that taking a mean between the disappearances and re-appearances of the disc, is a more correct method of observation than than pursued by Captain Kater, and that the intervals between the coincidences obtained, by observing the disappearances only of the disc, would be productive of error. In answer to this objection the author remarks, 1st, That with respect to the convertible pendulum, or that used for determining the absolute length of the seconds pendulum, the disc was made to subtend precisely the same angle as the tail-piece of the pendulum, so that at the moment of disappearance its centre necessarily coincided precisely with the middle of the tail-piece, and the difference between the moments of disappearance and re-appearance is rigorously nothing, an adjustment indispensable in his method of observing, when the object is to determine the true number of vibrations in 24 hours.</page>
<page id="256">2ndly. With the invariable pendulum, the disc subtended a somewhat less angle than the tail-piece, so that the inferred number of vibrations in 24 hours was diminished about.-yths of a second. But experiments with the invariable pendulum being intended to be in the strictest sense of the word comparative, this constant difference will no way affect the ultimate result. But as the most direct way to remove any doubts which may be entertained on the subject, the author has computed from the whole of Captain Sabine's observations, the successive differences in the vibrations at the various stations visited by him, by the two methods, viz. that of employing the disappearances and re-appearances, and the disappearances alone. The results only in one instance differ so much as a tenth part of a vibration. They are indifferently in excess and defect, and the mean of their discrepancies is exactly nothing. From this he concludes, that if the observations be made as nearly as possible under similar circumstances, the method of observing by disappearances alone is productive of no perceptible error in practice, in experiments with the invariable pendulum, while in those with the convertible pendulum the equal apparent size of the disc and tail-piece precludes the possibility of any, either in practice or theory, from this cause. The standard of Sir George Shuckburgh having been found identical with that of Bird, in the custody of the clerk of the House of Commons, adopted as the imperial standard unit of extension, the length of the pendulum already determined is fixed with the same degree of precision in parts of the Imperial standard yard. A repetition of Sir George Shuckburgh's experiments on the weight of given volumes of distilled water, and a re-measurement of the cube, sphere, and cylinder used by him, were found to give no material variation from his results; and these being stated in terms of the mean of several standard weights kept at the House of Commons, the troy pound nearest the mean has been adopted and declared by the legislature to be the original unit of weight under the denomination of the Imperial standard troy pound. The relation between this pound and the cubic inch of distilled water at 62? Fahrenheit, barometer 30 inches, has been ascertained by the Commissioners of Weights and Measures, who find that the latter contains 252,458 grains, each grain being the 5760 part of the standard troy pound. The avoirdupois pound is fixed for assigning its proportion to the standard troy pound, so as to contain exactly 7000 such grains. The Imperial standard gallon is defined by stating its contents under the same circumstances of temperature and pressure at 10 pounds avoirdupois; and the bushel, by its containing 80 such pounds. The author having, in compliancewith a request of the Lords Commissioners of His Majesty's Treasury, undertaken to superintend the construction of, and to adjust the principal standards to be deposited at the Exchequer, Guildhall, Dublin, and Edinburgh, Mr. Dollond was directed to prepare those of linear measure, and Mr. Bate those of weight and measure, the proper quality of metal for</page>
<page id="257">the latter purpose being determined by experiments instituted for the purpose. The experiments for adjusting them are then given in full detail. The troy pounds were first adjusted, and the exactness with which this operation has been performed may be appreciated from this,that the final errors of none of them exceed 2--oths of a grain. When brought so near, it was of course not thought necessary to attempt further correction. The avoirdupois pounds and the weights of the gallon of water were then derived from the troy pounds, and finally adjusted like them by inclosing within the weight, in hollows left for the purpose, wires equal to the errors ascertained to exist in them; the weights of these wires in each case is stated; so that should they by any accident be taken out and lost, they may be restored. He next describes the method used in adjusting the gallon itself, the method of filling it exactly and of weighing it when filled, together with the corrections depending on the circumstances of temperature and pressure under which the experiments were made. As a final result, it appears that one only of the gallons was ultimately found in error to a greater extent than 1-rths of a grain, the others having their errors less than a fourth of that quantity. The quarts and pints being next disposed of, the author describes the balance contrived by him for weighing the bushels, which proved so delicate as to turn with a single grain when loaded with 250 pounds in each scale. The resulting bushels when finally adjusted, were found to have all their apparent errors less than 6*56 grains of water, while the corrections for temperature and pressure only amounted in some cases to no less than 138 grains; but this depending on the figure of the glass used to cover them, it is not to be understood that the contents of the vessels have actually been ascertained to this degree of precision. The adjustment of the standard yards is next described; and the author concludes his paper by a summary of the results arrived at in the present inquiry respecting British weights and measures. The length, he remarks, of the pendulum vibrating seconds in London has been found in parts of the Imperial standard yard; so that the value of the yard may at any time be known, having been referred to a natural standard presumed unalterable. The length of the French metre, a standard expressing a certain portion of the terrestrial meridian, has also been given in parts of the English scale. The weight of a cubic inch of distilled water has been determined in parts of the Imperial troy pound, and thus the pound if lost may at any future time be recovered. The avoirdupois pound is now for the first time defined, and the measures of capacity are made to depend on the weight of water they contain; the Imperial gallon containing ten pounds avoirdupois of water, having been declared to be the unit or only standard measure of capacity, from which all others are to be derived. This, it is presumed, will tend powerfully to produce uniformity throughout the United Kingdom, by putting </page>
<page id="258">it in the power of every individual possessed of standard weights to verify his measures of capacity with the utmost facility. </page>
